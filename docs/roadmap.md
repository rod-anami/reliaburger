# Reliaburger Roadmap

This roadmap defines the implementation phases for Reliaburger, ordered by dependency. Each phase builds on the previous and ends with a concrete, demonstrable milestone.

**Methodology:** Every phase starts by writing tests, then implementing until they pass. Each phase produces a chapter of the Reliaburger book, combining design narrative with Rust implementation walkthrough. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the full methodology.

For the full architectural vision, see [whitepaper.md](whitepaper.md). For implementation details on each component, see the [design/](design/) directory.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation, Single-Node Container Lifecycle

Build the core single-node primitives: run a container, health-check it, restart it on failure.

Book: **Chapter 1, "Hello, Container"** (project setup, Rust basics, running a container)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- Grill: OCI spec generation, port allocation/release, cgroup path construction, container state machine transitions
- HealthChecker: priority queue scheduling, consecutive counter logic, state transition decisions, timeout handling
- NodeConfig: TOML parsing with all defaults and all fields, validation errors, auto-detection fallbacks

Integration tests:

- Container lifecycle: deploy app with 1 replica, verify running
- Health check: app returns 200, verify marked healthy
- Health check: app returns 500, verify marked unhealthy and restarted
- Health check: app hangs (no response), verify timeout detection
- Health check: recovery re-adds to service map
- Init container: failure prevents main container start
- Volume: write survives container restart
- Job: runs to completion and reports success
- Job: failed job retries up to limit
- Relish CLI: `status`, `logs`, `exec`, `inspect` return expected output
- Relish CLI: `logs --tail N` returns only last N lines
- Relish CLI: `logs --follow` streams new output via SSE

### Implementation

1. **Cargo workspace setup.** Binary crate (`bun`), library crate (`reliaburger`), test fixtures.
2. **TOML config parsing.** Define all 7 resource types (App, Job, Secret, ConfigFile, Volume, Permission, Namespace) with serde, including `[[app.*.init]]` blocks.
3. **Grill container runtime interface.** containerd/runc integration, OCI image extraction, port mapping, cgroup management.
4. **Bun agent core.** Process supervisor loop, health checks, restart logic, GPU detection (probe `/dev/nvidia0`, parse `nvidia-smi`).
5. **Relish CLI skeleton.** `apply`, `status`, `logs` (with `--tail` and `--follow`), `exec`, `inspect` (clap derive API, single-node mode).
6. **OCI image pulling.** Pull real images from Docker Hub via `oci-distribution`, unpack layers into rootfs with whiteout support, content-addressed blob caching.
7. **Rootless runc.** User namespace mapping, rootless cgroups v2, `--root` state directory, no-sudo container execution.
8. **Run all tests green.**

Design docs: [agent-bun.md](design/agent-bun.md), [cli-relish.md](design/cli-relish.md)

**Milestone:** `relish init && relish apply app.toml` runs a container on one node with health checks, logs (including `--tail` and `--follow`), and resource limits. All Phase 1 tests pass.

---

## Phase 2: Cluster Formation, Multi-Node Coordination

Add node discovery, leader election, and multi-node scheduling.

Book: **Chapter 2, "Finding Friends"** (networking, gossip protocols, distributed consensus)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- Mustard SWIM state machine: ALIVE → SUSPECT → DEAD transitions, incarnation number conflicts, piggyback dissemination
- Council selection: zone diversity scoring, stability filtering, tiebreaking determinism
- Meat scheduler simulation: bin-packing correctness, required/preferred label enforcement, daemon mode, quota enforcement, autoscaler stability

Integration tests:

- Gossip convergence: membership event propagates to all nodes within O(log N) protocol periods
- Raft leader election: kill leader on 5-member council. New leader elected within 5 seconds, log consistency verified.
- State reconstruction: populate cluster, kill leader. New leader's world view matches ground truth within learning period.
- Reporting tree failover: remove council member. Workers re-hash to surviving members.
- Scheduling: deploy 3 replicas, verify distinct nodes
- Scheduling: deploy daemon app (`replicas = "*"`), verify on all nodes
- Scheduling: deploy with required labels, verify correct placement
- Scheduling: deploy with preferred labels, verify fallback behaviour
- Scheduling: namespace quota rejection
- Scheduling: rolling deploy with zero downtime (continuous health probe)

Chaos tests (network namespace / iptables simulation):

- Council partition 3/2: majority elects leader, minority enters read-only. Heal and reconcile.
- Worker isolation: apps continue running, leader marks state-unknown.
- Full council loss: recovery candidate assumes leadership within `catastrophic_timeout`.

### Implementation

Each step is a self-contained PR with its own tests-first cycle.

1. **Shared types.** `NodeId`, `AppId`, `Resources`, `NodeCapacity`, `SchedulingDecision` newtypes in `src/meat/types.rs`. Foundation for all three subsystems.
2. **Mustard state machine.** SWIM node states (`Alive → Suspect → Dead`), incarnation-based conflict resolution, membership table, piggyback dissemination queue with priority ordering. Pure data structures, no networking yet.
3. **Mustard transport and protocol.** `MustardTransport` trait with `InMemoryMustardTransport` for testing. SWIM probe cycle: PING → ACK, timeout → PING-REQ via relay, still no ACK → mark Suspect. Integration test for gossip convergence across 5 in-memory nodes.
4. **Raft integration (openraft).** Wrap the `openraft` crate with three adapter implementations: `RaftLogStorage` (in-memory), `RaftNetwork` (TCP + in-memory mock), `RaftStateMachine` (applies `DesiredStateCommand` entries to cluster state). Integration tests for leader election, failover, and log replication.
5. **Council selection.** Automatic council member selection from membership table. Scores stability (node age), zone diversity, resource availability. Deterministic tiebreak via seeded RNG. Council size 3–7.
6. **Reporting tree.** Non-council nodes send `StateReport` to assigned council member every 5s. Assignment via consistent hashing. Council members aggregate for leader. Uses `tokio::sync::watch` for latest-value broadcasting.
7. **State reconstruction.** After leader election, new leader enters learning period. Collects StateReports, loads desired state from Raft log, diffs, issues corrections. No scheduling until 95% of nodes report or 15s timeout.
8. **Meat scheduler.** Four-phase placement pipeline (Filter → Score → Select → Commit). Bin-packing, required/preferred labels, daemon mode, GPU-aware, namespace quota enforcement. Property-based tests for scheduler correctness.
9. **Agent integration.** Wire mustard, raft, and meat into `BunAgent` as spawned tasks communicating via channels. Extend `ClusterSection` config with gossip/raft ports. Add cluster API endpoints (`/v1/cluster/nodes`, `/v1/cluster/council`, `/v1/cluster/leader`).
10. **CLI extensions.** New relish subcommands: `nodes`, `council`, `join` (unauthenticated until Phase 4).
11. **Chaos tests.** Council partition 3/2 (majority elects, minority read-only, heal and reconcile). Worker isolation (apps continue, state-unknown). Full council loss (recovery candidate assumes leadership).
12. **Book chapter and docs.** Write `docs/book/02-finding-friends.md`. Update progress, README.

Design docs: [gossip-mustard.md](design/gossip-mustard.md), [scheduler-meat.md](design/scheduler-meat.md)

**Milestone:** 3-node cluster with leader election, gossip-based failure detection, and app scheduling across nodes. All Phase 2 tests pass.

---

## Phase 2.1: Dev Cluster (`relish dev`)

One-command dev cluster using Lima VMs. The Reliaburger equivalent of `minikube start`. Spins up real Ubuntu VMs with rootless runc, gossip networking, and Raft consensus — a proper multi-node cluster on a laptop.

### Implementation

1. **Lima wrapper.** Shell out to `limactl` for VM lifecycle (create, start, stop, delete). Detect platform (arm64/amd64). Generate Lima YAML with Ubuntu cloud image, shared networking, and provisioning script that installs runc + downloads bun/relish from GitHub releases.
2. **Node configuration.** Generate `node.toml` per VM with correct join addresses and cluster ports. First node bootstraps Raft; subsequent nodes join via gossip.
3. **CLI subcommand.** `relish dev create`, `status`, `shell`, `stop`, `start`, `destroy`.
4. **GitHub release pipeline.** Cross-compile bun and relish for `linux-aarch64` and `linux-x86_64`. Attach to GitHub releases alongside PDFs.
5. **Docs.** Whitepaper section, README, book getting-started guide.

**Milestone:** `relish dev create --nodes 3` produces a working 3-node cluster. `relish test --chaos` partitions a council member and the cluster recovers.

---

## Phase 3: Networking, Service Discovery and Ingress

Enable service-to-service communication and external traffic ingress.

Book: **Chapter 3, "Talking to Each Other"** (eBPF, Linux networking, reverse proxies)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests (eBPF, using `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`):

- DNS interception: `.internal` name lookup, pass-through for non-`.internal`, malformed queries, case-insensitive matching
- Connect rewrite: VIP rewrite, ECONNREFUSED on no healthy backends, round-robin distribution

Integration tests:

- Service discovery: `dig redis.internal` returns the correct VIP from inside a container
- Service discovery: `curl http://web.internal:8080/` reaches a healthy backend
- Service discovery: namespace isolation enforced
- Service map consistency: deploy/scale/health-fail/recover/delete an app, verify BPF map state
- Ingress: TLS 1.3/1.2 handshake success, TLS 1.0/1.1 rejection
- Ingress: host-based routing exact match, mismatch returns 404
- Ingress: path-based routing (longest prefix match)
- Ingress: round-robin and least-connections load balancing
- Ingress: empty backend pool returns 502
- Ingress: WebSocket upgrade handshake, bidirectional data flow
- Ingress: drain completes slow request, drain timeout forces RST
- Ingress: rate limiting (under-limit pass, over-limit reject, Retry-After header)
- Perimeter firewall: external connections to non-ingress ports rejected
- `relish resolve redis` shows correct VIP, backends, health status

### Implementation

1. **Per-container network namespaces.** Network namespace creation, veth pairs, port mapping.
2. **Onion eBPF service discovery.** DNS interception, connect() rewrite, in-kernel service map.
3. **Wrapper ingress proxy.** Host/path-based routing, TLS termination, WebSocket support, health-aware load balancing, connection draining, rate limiting.
4. **nftables perimeter firewall.** Cluster boundary rules, management access control.

**Milestone:** Apps discover each other via `name.internal`, external traffic enters via Wrapper with automatic routing. All Phase 3 tests pass.

---

## Phase 4: Security, PKI and Identity

Establish the trust hierarchy and encrypt all cluster communication.

Book: **Chapter 4, "Trust No One (Until They Prove It)"** (PKI, mTLS, cryptography in Rust)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- Certificate chain validation, dual-signing period during rotation
- age encryption/decryption round-trip, namespace key isolation
- Token generation, validation, expiry, scope checking
- HKDF key derivation, AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt round-trip

Integration tests:

- mTLS: all inter-node traffic encrypted. Plain HTTP connections rejected.
- Workload identity: SPIFFE certificate issued, automatic rotation, OIDC JWT validation
- Join token: expiry enforced, single-use enforced
- Secret encryption: encrypt a value, deploy an app, verify it's decrypted in the container env
- Secret rotation: rotate key. Old and new ciphertexts accepted during transition; finalize drops old.
- Firewall: `allow_from` restrictions enforced. Unauthorized connections get ECONNREFUSED.
- Firewall: egress allowlist blocks unauthorized destinations.
- Firewall: `relish firewall test` diagnostic accuracy
- API auth: valid token succeeds, expired token rejected, insufficient scope rejected.
- Raft log encryption: encrypted at rest, readable after node restart.

## Phase 5: Storage & Registry, Image Distribution and Persistence

Build the image distribution layer and local volume management.

Book: **Chapter 5, "Where the Images Live"** (OCI registries, content-addressed storage, filesystem quotas)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- OCI manifest parsing, layer content-address verification
- Btrfs subvolume quota creation, loop mount enforcement
- Snapshot creation, compression, restoration

Integration tests:

- Push/pull round-trip: push multi-layer image, pull from same node (< 2s), pull from different node via P2P (< 5s)
- Replication: push succeeds only after N peer replications. Verify the image survives single node loss.
- Replication: under-replicated image auto-heals when a new node joins
- Pull-through cache: first pull from Docker Hub is cached, second pull served locally
- Image signing: signed image verified, unsigned image rejected when signing is required
- GC safety: active images aren't collected, unreferenced images are collected after retention, sole copy never deleted
- Local volumes: size limit enforced (write beyond quota fails)
- Volume snapshots: create snapshot, corrupt data, restore from snapshot, verify data intact
- Volume: write survives container restart but is lost on node reassignment (by design)

### Implementation

1. **Pickle registry.** OCI Distribution API, local content-addressed store, push with synchronous replication.
2. **Peer-to-peer layer distribution.** Parallel multi-source downloads.
3. **Pull-through cache.** Transparent caching for Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR.

- Auto-rollback: deploy a broken image. Verify it reverts to the previous version, and history records the reason.
- Dependency ordering: `run_before` job completes before app starts.
- Autoscaling: CPU load triggers scale-up within evaluation window. Scale-down on relief, stays within bounds.
- GitOps end-to-end: commit to local bare repo. Lettuce syncs within poll interval, app deployed.
- GitOps webhook: push triggers deploy within 5 seconds.
- GitOps rollback: git revert triggers rollback.
- GitOps coordinator failover: new coordinator resumes from `last_applied_commit`.
- Config tooling: `relish plan` shows correct diff. `relish lint` catches invalid config.

- Fault injection: CPU stress, memory fill, disk-io throttle (verified with cgroup metrics)
- Fault injection: process SIGKILL (reschedule), SIGSTOP/SIGCONT (health check cycle)
- Fault injection: 5s duration auto-clears, eBPF-level expiry verified
- Safety rails: partitioning a majority of council returns QuorumRisk error; killing all replicas returns ReplicaMinimum error
- Safety rails: faulting leader without `--include-leader` is rejected
- Batch scheduling: 100,000 job instances across 100 nodes, allocation under 1 second
- Build jobs: in-cluster image build, push to `pickle://`. Image available for deploy.
- Network security: eBPF inter-app firewall, egress allowlists, namespace isolation
- `relish fault clear` works via Unix socket when cluster API unavailable

Chaos tests (via Smoker):

- Kill leader mid-deploy: new leader completes the deploy from Raft state.
- Kill node: replicas rescheduled, zero downtime for multi-replica apps.
- Drain node: zero-downtime migration.
- Kill 2 of 3 replicas simultaneously: recovered within health timeout.
- Rapid leader elections (3 in 30s): cluster stabilizes.
- Node failure with volume app: alert fires, volume isn't lost.
- Resource exhaustion: OOM kill triggers restart + recovery, CPU stress triggers degraded state, disk full triggers alert + GC.
- Bun restart: containers keep running. Reconnects on restart, deploy resumes if interrupted.

### Implementation

1. **Smoker fault injection.** eBPF network faults (delay, drop, partition, DNS, bandwidth), resource faults (CPU/memory/disk), safety rails, expiry.
2. **Process workloads.** Exec/script apps and jobs, binary allowlist, mount namespace isolation, cgroup limits.

**Milestone:** Cluster-wide metrics queries work via hierarchical aggregation, Brioche dashboards show full detail views, alerts fire webhooks, and logs export to object storage. All Phase 11 tests pass.

## Phase 12: Optimisations, Performance Across Subsystems

Performance improvements and storage enhancements that span multiple subsystems.

Book: **Chapter 12, "Squeezing Every Drop"** (nftables maps, P2P distribution, compression, caching)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- nftables map generation: correct syntax, incremental updates, rollback on failure
- P2P chunk selection: rarest-first, parallel source balancing, dedup across sources
- Pull-through cache: upstream manifest resolution, cache hit/miss/stale paths
- Btrfs subvolume quota: creation, enforcement, resize
- Parquet bloom filter: construction, lookup true/false positive rates
- Zstd seekable frame: compression round-trip, random-access seek correctness

Integration tests:

- nftables maps: port mapping via maps matches iptables-rules behaviour, 1000-port stress test
- P2P downloads: push multi-layer image, pull from different node via P2P (< 5s for 100MB)
- P2P downloads: under-replicated image auto-heals when a new node joins
- Pull-through cache: first pull from Docker Hub is cached, second pull served locally
- Volume snapshots: create snapshot, corrupt data, restore from snapshot, verify data intact
- Volume snapshots: scheduled snapshot job runs on cron, uploads to object store
- Btrfs quotas: write beyond quota fails (where Btrfs is available)
- Parquet bloom filters: log query with bloom filter skips irrelevant row groups (verified via metrics)
- Zstd compression: archived logs readable after compression, space reduction > 5x

Property-based tests:

- P2P chunk selection: arbitrary topologies produce complete downloads
- Bloom filter: false positive rate stays below 1% for expected cardinalities

### Implementation

1. **nftables maps.** Replace per-rule port mapping with nftables named maps for O(1) lookup.
2. **P2P multi-source image downloads.** Parallel fan-out to peers, rarest-chunk-first selection, dedup.
3. **Pull-through cache.** Transparent caching for Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR via Pickle.
4. **Volume snapshots.** CoW snapshots, scheduled snapshot jobs, upload to S3/GCS.
5. **Btrfs subvolume quotas.** Alternative to loop mount for volume size enforcement.
6. **Parquet bloom filters.** Bloom filter on log `line` column to skip row groups in LIKE queries.
7. **Zstd seekable frame compression.** Compress archived log files with random-access seek support.
8. **Run all tests green.**

Design docs: [discovery-onion.md](design/discovery-onion.md), [registry-pickle.md](design/registry-pickle.md), [logs-ketchup.md](design/logs-ketchup.md)

**Milestone:** Port mapping uses O(1) nftables maps, images download from multiple peers in parallel, logs compress 5x with random-access reads. All Phase 12 tests pass.

## Phase 13: Relish TUI, Interactive Terminal Interface

Build the full interactive terminal UI for cluster management.

Book: **Chapter 13, "A Room with a View"** (TUI development with ratatui, event-driven rendering)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- TUI snapshot tests: ratatui TestBackend + insta for all views (dashboard, apps, nodes, jobs, events, logs, routes, search, help)
- TUI navigation tests: key sequences produce correct view stack transitions
- TUI data fetching: mock API responses render correctly in each view

Integration tests:

- TUI launches, renders dashboard, keyboard navigation works
- TUI: app detail view shows correct instance count and health status
- TUI: log view streams new lines in real time
- TUI: search filters results across all views
- TUI: help view lists all keybindings

### Implementation

1. **TUI framework.** ratatui + crossterm setup, event loop, view stack navigation.
2. **Dashboard view.** Cluster overview: node count, app count, alerts, resource usage.
3. **Apps view.** App list with health, replicas, version. Drill into app detail.
4. **Nodes view.** Node list with capacity, load, state. Drill into node detail.
5. **Jobs view.** Active and completed jobs, batch status.
6. **Events and logs views.** Real-time event stream, log tailing with grep.
7. **Routes and search views.** Ingress routing table, cross-view search.
8. **Run all tests green.**

Design docs: [cli-relish.md](design/cli-relish.md)

**Milestone:** `relish tui` launches a full interactive terminal UI for managing the cluster. All Phase 13 tests pass.

---

## Phase 14: Self-Upgrade, Rolling Binary Replacement

Enable zero-downtime binary upgrades across the cluster.

Book: **Chapter 14, "Changing the Tyres at Full Speed"** (rolling upgrades, signature verification, rollback)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- UpgradeManager: signature verification, symlink management, version retention/GC
- Version comparison: semver ordering, pre-release handling
- Rollback state machine: upgrade → verify → commit, upgrade → verify → rollback

Integration tests:

- Self-upgrade: upgrade a single node. Containers survive.
- Self-upgrade: roll back a single node. Revert succeeds.
- Self-upgrade: full rolling upgrade across the cluster (workers first, council, leader last).
- Self-upgrade: upgrade failure triggers automatic rollback.
- Self-upgrade: version retention GC keeps last 3 versions, deletes older.

### Implementation

1. **UpgradeManager.** Binary download, dual-signature verification (release key + build reproducibility), staging directory.
2. **Symlink swap.** Atomic binary replacement via symlink, old version retained for rollback.
3. **Rolling upgrade orchestration.** Workers first, then council members, leader last. Health check between each step.
4. **Automatic rollback.** Health check failure after upgrade triggers revert to previous binary.
5. **Version retention and GC.** Keep last N versions, garbage collect older binaries.
6. **Run all tests green.**

Design docs: [agent-bun.md](design/agent-bun.md)

**Milestone:** `relish upgrade --version v0.2.0` performs a rolling binary upgrade across the cluster with automatic rollback on failure. All Phase 14 tests pass.

---

## Phase 15: Testing, Benchmarking & Diagnostics

Build the self-validation tooling on top of the subsystem tests. This phase adds a live-cluster case catalogue, the benchmark harness and diagnostic tools. The built-in catalogue is separate from Cargo integration tests; it does not execute the test binaries in `tests/`. Complete live acceptance remains V01 in the current completion plan.

Book: **Chapter 15, "Ready for Production"** (built-in testing, performance measurement, cluster diagnosis)

### Tests (write first)

Unit tests:

- `wtf` correlation engine: known patterns produce correct diagnoses
- Benchmark result parsing, regression detection threshold logic
- Test runner: filter matching, parallel execution coordination, JSON report schema

Live acceptance goals (these are behaviours to qualify, not seven standalone
files under `tests/`):

- `relish test` runs the selected live catalogue and reports outcomes and cleanup
- `relish test --chaos` runs chaos suite and reports results
- `relish test --filter scheduling` runs only scheduling tests
- `relish bench` produces valid benchmark report with all metrics
- `relish bench --compare` detects regression (> 10% metric degradation)
- `relish wtf` detects and diagnoses known failure patterns
- `relish path <app> --to <app>` walks the network path hop by hop through eBPF, firewall, and network layers

Current test locations: runner and comparison regressions live in
`src/testkit/runner.rs` and `src/testkit/bench/compare.rs`; diagnostic and path
regressions live under `src/relish/wtf/` and in `src/relish/path_cmd.rs`.
`tests/suite/wtf_watch.rs` exercises the real CLI process. Live cases live under
`src/testkit/cases/` and `src/testkit/chaos/`; their complete three-node run is a
release gate, not something the unit-test count establishes.

### Implementation

1. **`relish test` command.** Built-in live catalogue with bounded parallel execution, filtering, capability/policy checks and JSON output for CI.
2. **`relish test --chaos`.** Five serial recovery scenarios using Smoker
   fault injection, fresh capability evidence, server-owned safety policy,
   explicit consent and exact panic-safe fault reversal. Missing destructive
   prerequisites fail rather than becoming green skips.
3. **`relish bench`.** Benchmark harness (scheduler throughput, eBPF latency, network throughput, deploy speed, state reconstruction), regression detection via `--compare`.
4. **`relish wtf`.** Automated cluster health diagnosis with root cause correlation.
5. **`relish path`.** End-to-end connectivity debugging through eBPF, firewall, and network layers.
6. **Run all tests green.**

Design docs: [cli-relish.md](design/cli-relish.md), [agent-bun.md](design/agent-bun.md), [chaos-smoker.md](design/chaos-smoker.md)

**Milestone:** `relish test` runs the full suite and reports all green. `relish bench` measures performance across all subsystems. `relish wtf` diagnoses common failure patterns. All Phase 15 tests pass.

## Phase 16: Post-Phase-15 Audit and Hardening

This follow-up repairs correctness gaps and reconciles the implementation,
manual and book. Its historical checklist is in
[progress.md](progress.md#phase-16-post-phase-15-audit--truthfulness--hardening),
with current unresolved work mapped to the
[completion plan](plans/archive/2026-09-17-codebase-completion-plan.md).
Each repair updates the relevant existing book chapter. Future architecture
families and optional refactors remain explicitly separate from release gates.

---

## Release closure: 0.1.0

The implementation and hardening work after Phase 15 is recorded in
[progress.md](progress.md), including Phase 16's audit fixes. The next delivery
is the [0.1.0 release plan](plans/2026-09-16-v0.1.0-release-plan.md), which closes
these phases with signed release artefacts, a managed laptop cluster and measured
acceptance on the downloaded product. It doesn't start a new architecture phase.

The release gates remain open until the actual candidate passes the portable,
Linux runtime, multi-node and clean-install checks. Historical phase checkboxes
are implementation evidence, not a substitute for those gates.

---

## Future (v2)

Features explicitly deferred to v2 (see whitepaper §22 for rationale):

- **TPM sealing.** Bind the master secret to TPM 2.0 PCRs so stolen disks can't unwrap CA keys on different hardware. Requires `tss-esapi` crate and physical TPM (Linux only).
- **External secret manager integration.** Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager.
- **Multi-cluster federation (Franchise).** The design is in whitepaper §21; implementation deferred to v2.
  - WAN gossip ring (Mustard extension) for cluster-level metadata exchange
  - Cross-cluster service discovery via `name.cluster.franchise` DNS (Onion extension)
  - Cross-cluster traffic via Wrapper ingress (no VPNs or tunnels)
  - Unified Brioche dashboard and `relish franchise status` CLI
  - Cross-cluster image pull via Pickle OCI API
  - Multi-cluster GitOps via Lettuce per-cluster directories
  - `relish franchise join` one-command peering with OIDC trust bundle exchange
- **IPv6 support.** Dual-stack networking, IPv6 virtual IPs.
- **Sidecars.** Co-located containers sharing a parent's network namespace and lifecycle.
- **Fractional GPU scheduling.** MIG partitions on NVIDIA A100/H100, time-slicing.
- **PromQL-to-SQL compatibility layer.** Translate `rate`, `sum by`, `avg by`, `histogram_quantile` to DataFusion SQL. Includes Prometheus remote-read API.
