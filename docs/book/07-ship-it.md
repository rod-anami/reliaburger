# Ship It

Up to now, deploying a new version of an app meant stopping the old one and starting the new one. If the new version was broken, users saw errors. If you had three replicas, all three went down at once. That's not how production works.

This chapter adds rolling deploys: replace instances one at a time, health-check each new instance before moving on, and automatically revert if anything goes wrong.

Reliaburger is meant to be batteries-included. In a Kubernetes world you'd reach for a Deployment controller, maybe Argo Rollouts, maybe a service mesh to handle the traffic shifting. That's three add-ons and a lot of YAML to do one thing: swap a running version for a new one without dropping requests. We want that in the box. So the whole machinery lives in one subsystem, `meat`, alongside the scheduler that already knows where instances run.

## Why deploys need a state machine

A deploy is not a single action. It's a sequence of coordinated steps, each of which can succeed, fail, or time out. The system needs to know exactly where it is in that sequence at all times, especially if the leader node crashes halfway through and a new leader has to pick up where it left off.

Picture the alternative. You write a function that starts the new version, waits, flips the routing, and stops the old one — top to bottom, no explicit state. It works on your laptop. Then in production the leader crashes between "flip routing" and "stop old version". The new leader has no idea what the old one was doing. Did the routing flip happen? Are there now two versions both serving traffic, or none? You can't tell, because the progress lived in a stack frame that died with the process.

The fix is to make the progress data, not control flow. Write down the current phase, commit it somewhere durable, and let any node read it back and continue. That's a state machine: an enum with a `transition` method that takes an event and produces the next state, or rejects the transition. The enum is the written-down progress; Raft (from Chapter 2) is the durable somewhere.

We also rejected shelling out to an external tool. A deploy needs to know the cluster's current placements, talk to the health checker, and rewrite the ingress routing table — all things the orchestrator already has in-process. Spawning `kubectl`-equivalent would mean re-plumbing all of that across a process boundary. Keeping it in `meat` is both simpler and faster.

## The deploy state machine

```rust
enum DeployPhase {
    Pending,
    RunningPreDeps,
    Rolling,
    Halted,
    Reverting,
    RolledBack,
    Completed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
}
```

Nine states. Every valid transition is a `match` arm. Every invalid transition returns an error. The compiler forces you to handle every case. You can't accidentally forget what happens when a step fails during the reverting phase — the compiler won't let you.

The happy path is simple: `Pending → Rolling → Completed`. Start the deploy, replace instances one by one, done.

The interesting paths are the failure ones. If a health check fails during rolling:
- With `auto_rollback = true`: `Rolling → Reverting → RolledBack` (revert all upgraded instances)
- With `auto_rollback = false`: `Rolling → Halted` (stop and let the operator decide)

If a pre-deploy dependency job fails: `RunningPreDeps → Failed` (no instances were touched, nothing to revert).

## Configuring a deploy

Before any of that runs, we turn the user's config into a `DeployConfig`. The app's TOML can set a few knobs — how long to wait for health, how long to drain, whether to auto-rollback — and anything it leaves out falls back to a sensible default:

```rust
impl Default for DeployConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            strategy: DeployStrategy::Rolling,
            max_surge: 1,
            max_unavailable: 0,
            drain_timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),
            health_timeout: Duration::from_secs(60),
            auto_rollback: true,
        }
    }
}
```

`Default` is a trait the standard library defines, and `#[derive(Default)]` or a hand-written `impl` gives a type its "empty" value. Python has no real equivalent — you'd scatter `None` defaults across a constructor's keyword arguments. Go has zero values, but you can't change what they are; a `bool` is always `false` by default. Here we say plainly: a deploy with nothing specified rolls one instance at a time, waits 60 seconds for health, and rolls back on failure.

Merging the user's overrides on top of those defaults shows off a Rust feature that landed recently, the *let-chain*:

```rust
pub fn from_spec(spec: &crate::config::app::DeploySpec) -> Self {
    let mut cfg = Self::default();
    if let Some(ref s) = spec.strategy
        && s == "blue-green"
    {
        cfg.strategy = DeployStrategy::BlueGreen;
    }
    if let Some(ref s) = spec.drain_timeout
        && let Some(d) = parse_duration(s)
    {
        cfg.drain_timeout = d;
    }
    // ... the rest of the fields, same shape ...
    cfg
}
```

Read `if let Some(ref s) = spec.strategy && s == "blue-green"` as: "if the strategy field is set (it's an `Option`, so it might be absent), bind its contents to `s`, *and* if `s` equals the string, then run the block." Both conditions in one `if`. Before let-chains you'd have nested two `if`s or written a `match`, drifting rightward with every optional field. A C programmer reads this like `if (spec->strategy && strcmp(s, "blue-green") == 0)`, except the compiler guarantees you can't touch `s` unless the value was actually present. There's no null to dereference.

`parse_duration` is a small helper that turns `"30s"` or `"5m"` into a `Duration`. It returns `Option<Duration>` rather than erroring, so a malformed string simply leaves the default in place — the second half of the let-chain (`&& let Some(d) = parse_duration(s)`) only assigns when parsing succeeds.

## The rolling sequence

Each instance replacement follows five sub-steps:

1. **Start** the new instance (same node, new image)
2. **Health check** — wait for the health probe to pass (up to `health_timeout`)
3. **Routing update** — add the new instance to the load balancer, remove the old one
4. **Drain** — wait for in-flight requests to the old instance to finish (up to `drain_timeout`)
5. **Stop** — kill the old instance

If the health check fails at step 2, we stop the new instance and don't touch the old one. The old instance is still serving traffic. Nothing broke. That's the whole point.

## The DeployDriver trait

The orchestrator doesn't call the supervisor directly. It uses a `DeployDriver` trait that abstracts every instance operation:

```rust
pub trait DeployDriver {
    fn start_instance(&self, app, node, image) -> Result<InstanceId>;
    fn await_healthy(&self, instance, timeout) -> Result<()>;
    fn add_to_routing(&self, app, instance) -> Result<()>;
    fn drain_instance(&self, instance, timeout) -> Result<()>;
    fn stop_instance(&self, instance) -> Result<()>;
    fn run_dependency_job(&self, job, image) -> Result<()>;
    fn current_placements(&self, app) -> Vec<(NodeId, InstanceId)>;
}
```

Why a trait instead of calling the supervisor directly? Testability. The state machine has a dozen edge cases (health failure at step 2 of 5 with rollback enabled, dependency job timeout, drain timeout with force-kill). Testing these against a real supervisor would be slow and flaky. With a mock driver, each test runs in microseconds.

This trait was earned, not speculative. We have exactly two implementations: `MockDriver` (for tests) and eventually `LocalDeployDriver` (for production). The abstraction exists because we need it, not because we might need it.

The orchestrator takes the driver as a *generic type parameter*, not a trait object:

```rust
pub struct DeployOrchestrator<D: DeployDriver> {
    state: DeployState,
    request: DeployRequest,
    driver: D,
}
```

`<D: DeployDriver>` reads "for any type `D` that implements `DeployDriver`". When you build a `DeployOrchestrator<MockDriver>`, the compiler stamps out a dedicated copy of the orchestrator with every `self.driver.start_instance(...)` call wired straight to `MockDriver::start_instance`. No vtable, no runtime indirection. This is *monomorphisation*: one generic written once, compiled into N concrete versions, one per type you actually use. C++ templates do the same thing; Java generics do not (they erase to `Object` and dispatch dynamically); Go only grew generics in 1.18 and still often reaches for interfaces.

The alternative would be `driver: Box<dyn DeployDriver>` — a trait object, where the concrete type is erased and each call goes through a pointer table at runtime. We use those elsewhere (the secret decryptor in Chapter 5 is one). Here, the orchestrator owns exactly one driver for its whole life and we know the type at construction, so the generic is both faster and simpler. Reach for `dyn` when you need a *collection* of mixed types behind one interface; reach for a generic when each instance is one known type.

## Automatic rollback

When `auto_rollback = true` (the default) and a step fails, the orchestrator reverses direction. For each step that already completed, it:

1. Removes the new instance from routing
2. Stops the new instance
3. Starts a fresh instance with the old image
4. Adds it to routing

The same `DeployDriver` methods, called in reverse order. The rollback itself can fail (if the old image is also broken), in which case the deploy enters the `Failed` state and the operator must intervene.

There was a leak here worth calling out. Rollback reverts the steps that *completed*, but a step can fail partway: `start_instance` succeeds, then `await_healthy` times out. That leaves a new instance running — started, unhealthy, recorded — that the rollback loop skipped, because it only walks completed steps, not the failed one. So every failed deploy orphaned a container and leaked its port. The fix is three lines in the failure branch: when a step fails, stop *its own* new instance before rolling back the earlier ones. The regression test starts two replicas, fails the second's health check, and asserts the second's new instance appears in the driver's stopped set — the assertion the original tests never made.

## Dependency ordering

Jobs can declare `run_before = ["app.web"]`, meaning they must complete before the rolling phase begins. Database migrations are the classic example: you want `migrate` to finish before `web` gets the new code.

The orchestrator models this as a `RunningPreDeps` phase. If any pre-deploy job fails, the deploy fails immediately and no instances are modified.

## From the model to the wired path

Here's a honesty note that's easy to skip past. Everything above — `DeployOrchestrator`, the `DeployDriver` trait, `execute_blue_green`, the exhaustive rollback tests — is a *model* of the deploy state machine. It's driven in tests by `MockDriver`, and it's where we work out the tricky transitions in microseconds. But it is not the code that runs on a node. The path that actually deploys your app lives in the Bun agent: `rolling_redeploy`, `blue_green_redeploy`, and an inline `run_before` gate, each calling the supervisor and the container runtime directly.

Why two versions of the same logic? Look back at the `DeployDriver` trait — every method is a plain `fn`, synchronous. The agent is `async` top to bottom: starting a container, waiting on a health probe, draining connections are all `.await` points. A synchronous trait can't `.await`, and bridging the two (blocking on a runtime handle inside an async task) is exactly the kind of thing that deadlocks under load. So the wired path is hand-rolled against the async supervisor, and the synchronous orchestrator stays as the model we test against. That's the honest state of it — the same trade-off you'll hit any time a clean synchronous abstraction meets an async runtime.

So what's actually wired:

- **`run_before`** — before an app deploys, the agent runs every job naming it in `run_before` to completion, polling the runtime until the job exits and gating on a clean exit code. A failure aborts the deploy; a gating job runs exactly once and is skipped in the regular jobs loop.
- **Blue-green** — `strategy = "blue-green"` dispatches to `blue_green_redeploy`, which brings the whole green fleet up and health-checks it while blue keeps serving, then swaps routing over and retires blue in one move. A green failure leaves blue untouched.
- **Scheduled jobs** — a job with a `schedule = "0 3 * * *"` doesn't run at deploy time at all. It's parsed by a small dependency-free cron matcher (`meat::cron`) and fired by the agent's one-second event-loop tick when its UTC minute matches, at most once per minute.

## Raft persistence

Deploy state is committed to Raft at every phase transition. If the leader dies mid-deploy, the new leader reads the last known state and can resume. This is why the phase is an enum we write down rather than a position in the code: a value survives a process death, a stack frame doesn't.

Finished deploys move into a per-app history so `relish history` and the API can show what shipped when. We don't keep it forever — an app that deploys fifty times a day would grow the Raft log without bound. The state machine caps it:

```rust
// Add to history (cap at 50 per app)
let history = self.deploy_history.entry(app_key).or_default();
history.push(DeployHistoryEntry::from_state(&state));
if history.len() > 50 {
    history.remove(0);
}
```

`entry(app_key).or_default()` is the Rust idiom for "get the vector for this app, creating an empty one if it's the first deploy". It's `HashMap`'s answer to Python's `dict.setdefault([])` or Go's check-then-insert dance, in one call. `remove(0)` drops the oldest entry once we pass fifty, so history is a sliding window of the last fifty deploys per app. A unit test (`deploy_history_capped_at_50`) deploys fifty-one times and asserts the length stays at fifty.

## Under the hood: key patterns

### The transition function

The state machine's core is a single `match` on `(current_phase, event)`:

```rust
pub fn transition(&mut self, event: DeployEvent) -> Result<(), DeployError> {
    let new_phase = match (&self.phase, &event) {
        (DeployPhase::Pending, DeployEvent::Start) => {
            if self.request.pre_deploy_jobs.is_empty() {
                DeployPhase::Rolling
            } else {
                DeployPhase::RunningPreDeps
            }
        }
        (DeployPhase::Pending, DeployEvent::Cancel) => DeployPhase::Cancelled,
        (DeployPhase::RunningPreDeps, DeployEvent::PreDepsComplete) => DeployPhase::Rolling,
        (DeployPhase::RunningPreDeps, DeployEvent::PreDepsFailed) => DeployPhase::Failed,
        (DeployPhase::Rolling, DeployEvent::StepFailed) => {
            if self.request.config.auto_rollback {
                DeployPhase::Reverting
            } else {
                DeployPhase::Halted
            }
        }
        // ... more arms ...
        _ => {
            return Err(DeployError::InvalidTransition {
                from: self.phase,
                event,
            });
        }
    };

    self.phase = new_phase;
    self.phase_changed_at = SystemTime::now();
    Ok(())
}
```

The wildcard `_` catches every `(phase, event)` combination not explicitly listed. In Go or Java, that would be a `default:` case that's easy to forget. In Rust, the compiler enforces exhaustiveness. Add a tenth state and every `match` that doesn't handle it becomes a compile error. You can't ship a deploy that forgets what to do when a new phase is reached.

The conditional logic within arms (checking `pre_deploy_jobs.is_empty()`, `config.auto_rollback`) keeps the state machine compact. Each arm is a function from (state, event, context) to next state. No separate transition table, no matrix to maintain.

### The drive loop

`transition` only moves the phase marker. Something has to actually *do* the work and feed events back in. That's `execute`:

```rust
pub fn execute(&mut self) -> Result<DeployResult, DeployError> {
    self.state.transition(DeployEvent::Start)?;

    if self.state.phase == DeployPhase::RunningPreDeps {
        match self.execute_pre_deps() {
            Ok(()) => self.state.transition(DeployEvent::PreDepsComplete)?,
            Err(e) => {
                let _ = self.state.transition(DeployEvent::PreDepsFailed);
                return Err(e);
            }
        }
    }

    let total = self.state.steps.len();
    for i in 0..total {
        self.state.current_step = i;
        match self.execute_step(i) {
            Ok(()) => {
                self.state.steps[i].phase = StepPhase::Completed;
                self.state.transition(DeployEvent::StepCompleted(i))?;
            }
            Err(_e) => {
                self.state.steps[i].phase = StepPhase::Failed;
                let _ = self.state.transition(DeployEvent::StepFailed(i));
                if self.state.phase == DeployPhase::Reverting {
                    match self.execute_rollback(i) {
                        Ok(()) => {
                            let _ = self.state.transition(DeployEvent::RollbackComplete);
                        }
                        Err(_) => {
                            let _ = self.state.transition(DeployEvent::RollbackFailed);
                        }
                    }
                }
                return self.terminal_result();
            }
        }
    }

    self.state.transition(DeployEvent::AllStepsComplete)?;
    self.terminal_result()
}
```

The shape is: do an operation, then feed the result back as an event. A successful step emits `StepCompleted`; a failed one emits `StepFailed`, and the *state machine* decides whether that means `Reverting` or `Halted` based on the config. The drive loop doesn't encode that policy — it just asks the state machine where it is now (`if self.state.phase == DeployPhase::Reverting`) and acts accordingly. Notice how the two responsibilities stay separate: `transition` knows the *rules*, `execute` knows the *actions*. That split is what makes the rules testable without doing any actual I/O, which we'll lean on heavily in the tests.

One subtlety in the failure arm: when we transition into a terminal failure state we use `let _ = self.state.transition(...)` rather than `?`. We're already returning an error result; if recording the failure transition itself failed, propagating *that* error would mask the real one. So we deliberately discard it.

### `relish deploy`, `history`, and `rollback`

The CLI is a thin client over the agent's HTTP API. `relish deploy` streams rollout progress to your terminal as each step changes phase, so you watch the deploy march through `Starting → HealthChecking → RoutingUpdate → Draining` per instance. `relish history <app>` prints the sliding window of past deploys. And `relish lint` validates an app's config (including the deploy section) before you ever ship it, catching a bad `drain_timeout` string or an unknown strategy at author time rather than mid-rollout.

`relish rollback <app>` deserves its own paragraph, because for a long time it was a lie. The command read the last successful entry from history and *printed* the image name, followed by "(use `relish apply` with the previous config to rollback)". It rolled nothing back; it told you to. Worse, it couldn't have worked even if it tried: the deploy history stored the image string but not the *spec*, so there was nothing to re-apply. And the fresh-deploy path — the very first deploy of an app — recorded no history at all, so a two-deploy app only had one entry.

The fix threads through the whole path. Deploy history entries now carry the full `AppSpec` (`Option<Box<AppSpec>>`, defaulted so old entries still deserialise), every deploy path records one including the first, and `POST /v1/rollback/{app}/{namespace}` finds the last-but-one successful spec and redeploys it through the same machinery as `apply` — Raft in cluster mode, a local deploy otherwise. "Last-but-one" matters: the newest successful entry is the version you're running *now*, so rollback targets the one before it. With no previous version, you get a clean 404, not a redeploy of the current one.

This is a small feature with a sharp lesson: a command that describes an action instead of performing it is worse than no command, because it looks done. `relish rollback` had a help string, a history lookup, and formatted output — everything except the rollback.

### Mock driver with failure injection

The `MockDriver` uses the builder pattern to configure failures at specific steps:

```rust
pub struct MockDriver {
    placements: Vec<(NodeId, String)>,
    next_instance_id: RefCell<u32>,
    fail_health_at_step: Option<usize>,
    step_counter: RefCell<usize>,
}

impl MockDriver {
    pub fn fail_health_at(mut self, step: usize) -> Self {
        self.fail_health_at_step = Some(step);
        self
    }
}
```

`RefCell<u32>` is Rust's way of getting interior mutability when the borrow checker won't let you take `&mut self`. The `DeployDriver` trait methods take `&self` (because the orchestrator borrows the driver immutably during the deploy), but the mock needs to mutate its counters. `RefCell` moves the borrow check to runtime — it panics if you try to borrow mutably twice, but in single-threaded test code, that never happens.

You could avoid `RefCell` by making the trait methods take `&mut self`. But then every test needs exclusive access to the driver, which means the orchestrator can't hold a reference during the deploy. The `RefCell` compromise is the standard pattern for test mocks in Rust.

### Rolling deploy: five sub-steps per instance

```rust
fn execute_step(&mut self, idx: usize) -> Result<(), DeployError> {
    // 1. Start new instance
    self.state.steps[idx].phase = StepPhase::Starting;
    let (new_id, _port) = self.driver.start_instance(app_id, &node, image)?;

    // 2. Health check
    self.state.steps[idx].phase = StepPhase::HealthChecking;
    self.driver.await_healthy(&new_id, config.health_timeout)?;

    // 3. Routing update
    self.state.steps[idx].phase = StepPhase::RoutingUpdate;
    self.driver.add_to_routing(&app_id.name, &new_id)?;
    if let Some(ref old_id) = self.state.steps[idx].old_instance {
        self.driver.remove_from_routing(&app_id.name, old_id)?;
    }

    // 4. Drain old instance
    self.state.steps[idx].phase = StepPhase::Draining;
    if let Some(ref old_id) = self.state.steps[idx].old_instance {
        let _ = self.driver.drain_instance(old_id, config.drain_timeout);
    }

    // 5. Stop old instance
    if let Some(ref old_id) = self.state.steps[idx].old_instance {
        let _ = self.driver.stop_instance(old_id);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Two things worth noticing. First, the step phase is updated *before* each operation. If the process crashes between phase update and operation completion, the new leader knows exactly where the deploy was interrupted. The state is always slightly ahead of reality, which is safe — retrying an idempotent operation is fine; skipping one is not.

Second, drain and stop errors are silently ignored (`let _ = ...`). A drain timeout means in-flight requests may get cut off, but the deploy should continue. A stop failure means the old container might linger, but the new one is already serving traffic. These are operator-visible problems, not deploy-blocking failures.

## Wiring drain, surge and rollback into the live path

Everything above describes the deploy *state machine* — the library that decides what should happen. For a long time that machine was the honest part and the live Bun agent was the shortcut. When you redeployed a running app, the agent started the new instances, then reached straight for `kill` on the old ones. No drain. In-flight HTTP and WebSocket traffic got the rug pulled out from under it mid-request. The `DrainTracker` we built in the Wrapper existed, had tests, and was wired to nothing.

Two problems, then, and both are about the gap between "we told it to stop" and "it actually stopped".

### The drain tracker reaches the real proxy

The Wrapper proxy and the Bun agent are separate tasks. They already share one thing: the routing table, behind an `Arc<RwLock<RoutingTable>>`. When the agent rebuilds routes after a deploy, the proxy sees the new table on its next request. We give them a second shared thing — the drain tracker:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct SharedDrains(Arc<Mutex<DrainTracker>>);
```

`Arc<Mutex<T>>` is Rust's way of sharing something mutable between tasks. The `Arc` (atomically reference-counted pointer) hands out cheap clones that all point at the same tracker; the `Mutex` makes sure only one task mutates it at a time. We reach for the *tokio* `Mutex`, not the one in `std`, because a tokio mutex yields the task while it waits for the lock instead of blocking the whole runtime thread. Blocking a runtime thread on a lock is the kind of thing that wedges an async system under load.

The agent owns a `SharedDrains` and hands a clone to the proxy when it binds the ingress listeners. Now the two sides can cooperate. When a request arrives for a backend that's draining, the proxy bumps that instance's in-flight count, and drops it again when the response finishes:

```rust
let _drain_guard = match &state.drains {
    Some(drains) if drains.is_draining(&instance_id).await => {
        drains.increment_connections(&instance_id).await;
        Some(DrainGuard { drains: drains.clone(), instance_id })
    }
    _ => None,
};
```

`DrainGuard` is a small RAII type — hold it for the request's lifetime, and its `Drop` releases the count on *every* exit path, including the error returns and the early `502`s. Rust runs `Drop` deterministically when a value leaves scope, so there's no way to forget the decrement. There's one wrinkle: `Drop` can't be `async`, and our decrement is. So the guard's `Drop` spawns a tiny task to do the async release. It runs promptly; the count comes back down.

### Retire means drain, then wait for exit

With the proxy reporting in-flight traffic, the agent's retire path can finally do the right thing:

```rust
async fn drain_and_stop_instance<G: Grill>(
    drains: &SharedDrains,
    grill: &G,
    id: &InstanceId,
    drain_timeout: Duration,
) {
    drains.start_drain(&drain_command(id, drain_timeout)).await;
    drains.wait_drained(&id.0).await;
    // stop, poll until Stopped, kill if the grace elapses
}
```

Before this runs, the deploy publishes the *new* backends and rebuilds the routing table. So by the time we start draining, the proxy is already sending new requests to the fresh instances. The old ones only have to wait out the requests they were already handling. `wait_drained` polls until the instance's in-flight count hits zero or its deadline passes — new traffic already goes elsewhere, so this is a countdown, not a losing battle.

Notice what this function *takes*: a drain handle and a grill, both cloneable, and no `&self`. That's deliberate, and it's the second half of a lesson that took two rounds to learn. Our first version was a method on the agent, called from the finaliser — which runs on the agent's command loop. The command loop is the single owner of all agent state; while one command executes, every other command waits. A drain is a wait of up to `drain_timeout` *per instance*, and a blue-green cut-over retires the whole old fleet at once. Do that arithmetic on the loop and a routine redeploy of a three-replica app freezes health checks, status queries and cluster RPC for up to ninety seconds. The fix is a division of labour: the spawned deploy worker owns every wait (it calls this free function per instance), and the loop gets only fast bookkeeping messages — "this one's drained and stopped, forget it". The cut-over ordering is preserved by doing it in three steps: publish the green backends (fast, on the loop), drain and stop blue (slow, on the worker), then tear down the old bookkeeping (fast, on the loop). A test pins the ordering by holding a connection open on blue and asserting green is routable — and the agent still answers commands — mid-drain.

This is where `max_unavailable` becomes real rather than aspirational. The rolling path brings a new replica up and healthy *before* it retires an old one, so the count of serving instances never dips below the target: while the old ones drain, the new ones are already taking traffic.

Read that back with `max_surge` in mind, though, and something's missing. "Bring every new replica up, then retire the old ones" satisfies `max_unavailable = 0` beautifully. It also completely ignores `max_surge`. On a three-replica app it means six containers at peak, whatever you configured — and the default is `max_surge = 1`, which asks for four.

So one of the two knobs was load-bearing and the other was decoration. `max_surge` parsed, validated, appeared in the config docs, and changed nothing. That's a worse failure than not supporting it at all: an operator who sets `max_surge = 1` because the node hasn't the headroom for double has been told their constraint is respected, and it isn't.

The two bounds are really one small decision, repeated:

```rust
pub fn plan_rolling_step(
    target: u32,
    new_healthy: u32,
    new_pending: u32,
    old_remaining: u32,
    max_surge: u32,
    max_unavailable: u32,
) -> RollingStep {
    if new_healthy >= target && old_remaining == 0 {
        return RollingStep::Done;
    }
    let serving = new_healthy + old_remaining;
    let total = new_healthy + new_pending + old_remaining;

    let owed = new_healthy + new_pending < target;
    if owed && total < target.saturating_add(max_surge) {
        return RollingStep::StartNew;
    }
    if old_remaining > 0 && serving > target.saturating_sub(max_unavailable) {
        return RollingStep::RetireOld;
    }
    // …
}
```

`max_surge` gates starting (how far above the target may `total` go?), `max_unavailable` gates retiring (how far below may `serving` fall?). Ask that question repeatedly and the rollout walks itself: with the defaults it starts one, retires one, starts one, retires one. With `max_surge = 0, max_unavailable = 1` it retires *first* and never exceeds the target, which is what you want when there's no spare capacity at all.

Two things fell out of writing it this way.

The first is that `max_surge = 0` and `max_unavailable = 0` together are unsatisfiable. You may not go above the target, so you can't start a replacement; you may not go below it, so you can't retire anything. Nothing in the config validated that pair, so it would have produced a rollout that looked live and made no progress. The planner returns a distinct `Stuck` for it and `DeployConfig::validate` rejects it at apply time with an explanation. When you write a rule as an explicit predicate, its unsatisfiable cases tend to walk up and introduce themselves; buried in a loop they'd have stayed hidden until someone hit one.

The second is a hazard the interleaving created. Retiring old instances *during* the rollout rather than all at the end means the command loop gets a turn between retirements — and a deliberately stopped instance still sitting in `supervisor.instances` looks exactly like a crashed one to the restart driver, which would helpfully bring it back. So retirement drops the instance from the supervisor in the same turn that stops it (`Supervisor::retire_instance`). Interleaving two loops that used to run one-after-the-other is a reliable way to discover which of your invariants were really just orderings.

Testing this is where the pure planner pays off. The unit tests don't assert step sequences — that would pin the implementation — they replay a whole rollout and assert the *envelope*: peak total and minimum serving. A proptest then does the same for every combination of target, existing count and bounds that validation permits. And because a planner nothing calls is worse than no planner (this codebase has a long history of exactly that), there are agent-level tests that replay the grill's call log to count live containers: three replicas with `max_surge = 1` peak at four, and they peak at six against the old code.

### "Healthy" has to mean the app answered

One more audit finding, and it's the one that would have hurt most in production. The opening of this chapter promised "health-check each new instance before moving on". The live path's version of that promise was a poll on `grill.state == Running` — the *runtime's* view. The process came up, the container didn't crash, so: healthy, publish the backend, retire an old instance. At no point did anyone ask the app the question the operator configured: does `GET /healthz` return 200?

Run the failure through. You ship a version with a broken database password. The process starts fine — it only discovers the bad credential when the health check's handler tries to connect. The old rolling path sees `Running`, announces "healthy ✓", routes traffic to it, and drains the instance that was actually serving. Repeat per replica, and a config typo has replaced your whole healthy fleet with instances that answer every request with a 500. The health check you configured does eventually run — after the deploy finalises, when the ordinary monitoring tick picks the instance up and marks it `Unhealthy` three probes later. The system notices; it just notices after the damage rather than instead of it.

The reason the check couldn't run earlier is structural, and worth understanding. During a rollout, the replacement instance doesn't exist in the supervisor yet — it's the deploy worker's private business until the finaliser installs it. The steady-state health tick probes instances the supervisor knows about, so mid-deploy there is nothing for it to probe. Registering the instance earlier would have meant the restart driver and the deploy worker fighting over a half-created instance (we already met that hazard with retirement). The fix goes the other way: the deploy worker, which already owns every wait, gates itself. `wait_instance_healthy` waits for `Running`, then — when the app declares a health check — runs the same HTTP probe the monitoring tick uses (same config, same `initial_delay`, same thresholds) until it passes or the deploy's `health_timeout` expires. Only then is the backend published; on failure the existing rollback machinery takes over, and the old instances never stop serving. Apps without a health check keep the `Running`-only behaviour — we can't ask a question the operator didn't configure.

The tests for this had a blind spot worth confessing. Every deploy test drove a `MockGrill` whose `state()` says `Running`, so "container runs" and "app answers" were indistinguishable by construction — the gate could not be tested against a fake that has no notion of HTTP. The regression tests bind a real TCP listener on a loopback port, point the app's health check at it, and run the genuine `probe_health` through the deploy: a responder that answers 500 must leave the old instance serving and the deploy rolled back; flip it to 200 and the rollout completes. When a bug survives because the test double can't express it, the fix needs a test the double isn't in.

### Stop must wait for the process to actually exit

The second problem is subtler and it bit the ordinary `relish stop` too. The agent sent SIGTERM, then immediately marked the instance `Stopped` and moved on. But SIGTERM is a *request*. A process can take a moment to flush and exit, or ignore the signal entirely. Recording `Stopped` before the process is gone lets two sources of truth drift apart: the supervisor says "stopped", the container says "still running, still serving". That divergence is exactly the kind of lie that makes an orchestrator untrustworthy.

The fix is to wait for the exit and escalate if it doesn't come:

```rust
async fn stop_and_wait_for_exit(&self, id: &InstanceId, grace: Duration) {
    let _ = self.supervisor.grill().stop(id).await;   // SIGTERM
    let deadline = Instant::now() + grace;
    while Instant::now() < deadline {
        if matches!(self.supervisor.grill().state(id).await, Ok(ContainerState::Stopped)) {
            return;                                     // clean exit
        }
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    }
    if !matches!(self.supervisor.grill().state(id).await, Ok(ContainerState::Stopped)) {
        let _ = self.supervisor.grill().kill(id).await; // SIGKILL
    }
}
```

SIGTERM, poll for the exit up to a grace period, then SIGKILL whatever's left. The `shutdown_all` path had this pattern already; now the ordinary stop and the rolling retire share it. Only once the runtime confirms the exit does the supervisor record `Stopped`. Container state and supervisor state can't diverge, because we don't write the second one down until the first one is true.

Well, almost. Look at the last line of that listing: `let _ =` throws away the result of `kill`, and nothing checks that SIGKILL actually worked. We come back to that hole in "A deploy owns what it starts" below.

The tests pin all three behaviours honestly. One holds an in-flight request open through the live proxy and asserts the drain doesn't complete until the request returns. One drives a rolling redeploy and asserts the new instance's `start` lands before the old instance's `stop` — surge-first, availability preserved. And one makes the mock runtime ignore SIGTERM, then asserts the stop escalates to `kill` rather than lying that the app is down.

## What we learned

### Traits earn their keep when you have two implementations

The CLAUDE.md says "Don't write a trait until you have two implementations." The `DeployDriver` trait has exactly two: `MockDriver` and `LocalDeployDriver`. The mock runs tests in microseconds. The local driver calls the real supervisor. Same orchestration logic, same state machine, different I/O. The trait abstraction carries its weight.

If we'd only had one implementation, a direct function call to the supervisor would have been simpler. The trait exists because we need it, not because someone might need it someday.

### Drain errors are non-fatal for a reason

The first version treated drain failures as deploy errors. A deploy would fail because one in-flight request didn't finish before the 10-second drain timeout. The operator would see "deploy failed", panic, check the logs, find nothing wrong, and re-deploy. Same thing would happen again if a slow request was in flight.

Making drain non-fatal was a one-character change (`?` to `let _ =`). It fixed the false-failure problem completely. Sometimes the right abstraction is less error handling, not more.

### Rollback uses the same driver, backwards

We considered a separate `RollbackDriver` trait. Then we realised rollback is just: stop the new instance, start the old one, update routing. The exact same operations, in reverse order. Adding a second trait would have doubled the interface surface for zero benefit.

### A generic beat a trait object here

The first sketch stored the driver as `Box<dyn DeployDriver>`. It worked. But the orchestrator only ever holds one driver of one known type, so the dynamic dispatch bought us nothing — just a pointer indirection on every call and a heap allocation we didn't need. Switching to `DeployOrchestrator<D: DeployDriver>` made the tests read identically and the production path a hair faster. The lesson isn't "generics good, `dyn` bad". It's: match the tool to the shape. One known type for the lifetime of the struct wants a generic; a runtime-varying mix wants `dyn`.

## Tests

We wrote the tests before the orchestrator, as the roadmap demands, and they fall into three layers.

### Transition tests — the rules in isolation

The state machine is pure: feed it an event, check the resulting phase. No I/O, no async, no mocks. So `src/meat/deploy_types.rs` holds one tiny test per edge of the graph, named as sentences:

```rust
#[test]
fn step_failed_with_auto_rollback_goes_to_reverting() { ... }

#[test]
fn step_failed_without_auto_rollback_goes_to_halted() { ... }
```

Every valid transition gets a test, and so do the forks that depend on config (`auto_rollback` on versus off). Because the `match` is exhaustive, we don't need a test for "what happens on an undefined transition" beyond one check that it returns `DeployError::InvalidTransition` — the compiler already proved every `(phase, event)` pair is handled. There's also `deploy_history_capped_at_50`, which deploys fifty-one times and asserts the window holds at fifty.

### Orchestrator tests — the actions, with a mock driver

`src/meat/orchestrator.rs` tests the drive loop against `MockDriver`, configured to fail at a chosen step:

```rust
#[test]
fn health_failure_with_auto_rollback() {
    let driver = MockDriver::new(placements(1)).fail_health_at(1);
    let mut orch = DeployOrchestrator::new(id, request("v2"), driver);
    let result = orch.execute().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(result, DeployResult::RolledBack);
}
```

The roster covers `happy_path_single_replica`, `no_existing_instances_creates_one`, `health_failure_with_auto_rollback`, `health_failure_without_auto_rollback`, `start_failure_at_step`, `dependency_job_success`, `dependency_job_failure`, and `rollback_restores_previous_instances` (which checks the old instance IDs come back after a revert). Each runs in microseconds because no container is ever started — that's the whole reason the `DeployDriver` trait exists.

### Integration tests — the real agent

`tests/integration.rs` exercises the agent end to end with a real (process-backed) runtime: `deploy_app_reaches_running`, `health_check_failing_app_marked_unhealthy`, `job_runs_to_completion`, `job_failed_retries_then_fails`, `init_container_success_allows_app_start`, and `init_container_failure_prevents_start`. These are slower (they spin up the agent and poll real state) but they prove the wiring the mocks can't.

### Running them

Everything in this chapter runs under a plain:

```sh
cargo test
```

There are no gated tests here — no eBPF, no root, no network, no platform-specific runtime. (Those arrive in the networking, registry, and chaos chapters.) To run just this chapter's suites:

```sh
cargo test --lib meat::deploy_types     # transition tests
cargo test --lib meat::orchestrator     # orchestrator + mock driver
cargo test --test integration           # full agent lifecycle
```

Read the output bottom-up: cargo prints `test result: ok. N passed` per binary. A failing transition test names the exact edge that broke (`step_failed_without_auto_rollback_goes_to_halted`), which tells you which `match` arm regressed without reading a stack trace.

## Applied means done, not queued

The per-node reconciler (Chapter 2) is what actually converges a node onto the leader's plan: it polls `GET /v1/placements/{node}`, and for any app whose assignment appeared or changed, it hands the agent a `Deploy` command. To avoid re-deploying the same thing every two seconds, it remembers what it last applied in a small map: `(name, namespace) → fingerprint`, where the fingerprint is the serialised spec. Same fingerprint next tick? Skip it.

Two things were wrong with that map, and they're the kind of wrong that only bites in production.

First, "applied" meant "I put the command on the queue", not "the deploy succeeded". The reconciler marked the fingerprint applied the instant the channel `send` returned `Ok` — before a single container started, before any health check passed. A deploy that failed *after* acceptance (bad image, port clash, a crash on start) was recorded as done and never retried. The node sat there convinced it had converged onto an app that wasn't running.

The fix is to wait for the deploy's *terminal* outcome. The agent already streams `ApplyEvent`s back over a channel — `Progress`, then a final `Complete` or `Error`. So instead of draining and discarding those events, the reconciler now reads them to the end and only records the fingerprint on `Complete`:

```rust
async fn deploy_succeeded(mut events: mpsc::Receiver<ApplyEvent>) -> bool {
    while let Some(event) = events.recv().await {
        match event {
            ApplyEvent::Complete { .. } => return true,
            ApplyEvent::Error { .. } => return false,
            _ => {}
        }
    }
    false
}
```

If the deploy fails, `applied` is left untouched, so the next tick retries it. "Applied" now means what it says.

That `bool` had a cost we only noticed while chasing a flaky test. A Runc init container kept failing its first deploy, and all a node's log said was that it had retried. The agent's `Error` event said which init container failed, but the `ApplyEvent::Error { .. }` pattern threw the message away (`..` means "ignore the remaining fields"). Even the agent's message was thin: "init container 0 failed". The real reason, `runc run failed: container's cgroup is not empty`, sat in a file on disk that nobody read.

So the function became `deploy_outcome`, and it returns a `Result` whose error says why:

```rust
enum DeployWaitError {
    Failed(String),      // the agent's own message
    Closed,              // the stream ended without an outcome
    TimedOut(Duration),  // no terminal event in time
}
```

The reconciler logs that error before it retries. At the other end, when an init container fails the agent reads the last 400 bytes of what the runtime wrote to its stderr and appends them to the failure, next to the exit code. It reads a tail with a seek rather than the whole file, because an init container that dumps megabytes of output and then fails shouldn't get megabytes into a log line. Now the node's log says `init container 0 failed for instance default__web-0: exited with code 1: runc run failed: container's cgroup is not empty: 1 process(es) found`, and you know where to look.

Second, the map lived only in memory. Restart bun — a crash, a self-upgrade — and it forgot everything it had applied. On the next tick it would re-deploy *every* assigned app from scratch, even ones already happily running, churning containers for no reason. So the applied map is now durable: a tiny JSON checkpoint written atomically (temp file, then rename, so a crash mid-write can't leave a torn file) and reloaded on boot. A restarted reconciler picks up where it left off. A missing checkpoint loads empty. A corrupt or unreadable one refuses to reconcile, because treating it as empty would forget apps this node still runs. The checkpoint is self-describing JSON with a `schema` field, so a future format change fails loudly instead of mis-parsing an old file into nonsense.

Put the two fixes together and the restart story is nearly correct. The remaining gap: a worker receives `api`, starts a container and dies before recording success. While it's down, you remove `api`. On restart the checkpoint has no entry for it, so nothing ever retires that container. It has fallen between two records. So each entry is now one of two states:

```rust
pub enum AssignmentState {
    /// Ownership is durable, but deployment has not been confirmed.
    Pending,
    /// The assignment completed successfully at this serialised specification.
    Applied { fingerprint: String },
}
```

Rust enum variants can carry data: `Pending` carries nothing, `Applied { fingerprint }` carries a string, a bit like a tagged union in C where the compiler checks the tag for you. The reconciler writes `Pending` *before* it queues the `Deploy` command and upgrades it to `Applied` only on `Complete`. Both states mean "this node owns resources for the app", so a withdrawn assignment in either state needs a confirmed retirement before its entry disappears. A restarted bun now neither double-deploys converged work nor forgets an interrupted deploy.

## Stopping an app is a decision, not a signal

Stopping an app in a cluster used to be a local affair. `POST /v1/stop/{app}/{namespace}` sent the receiving node's agent a `Stop` command, that node killed its local replicas, and the handler returned. Done — except it wasn't.

The app is *desired state* in Raft. The scheduler places it because the council says it should exist. Kill the local containers and leave the desired state alone, and the very next reconcile tick sees an app that's supposed to be running and isn't, and helpfully deploys it again. You can't stop an app by fighting the reconciler; you have to change its mind. And there's a second failure: ask the *leader* to stop an app it holds no replica of, and the old handler returned a 404 — "no such app here" — even though the app plainly existed cluster-wide.

Both symptoms have one cause: stop wasn't going through Raft. Now it does. In cluster mode, `stop` proposes an `AppDelete` request to the council, exactly the way `apply` proposes an `AppSpec`. The desired state clears, the scheduler stops placing the app, and no reconciler resurrects it. The local container stop becomes best-effort cleanup that runs *after* the delete commits — and because a missing local replica is expected on a leader that holds none, it's no longer an error. Followers can't write to Raft (openraft doesn't forward client writes), so a stop received on a follower forwards to the leader's API, the same leader-forwarding dance `apply` already does. A gated three-node test proves the whole loop: deploy an app, stop it through any node, and watch the desired state clear and *stay* clear across several reconcile ticks.

## A slow deploy shouldn't freeze the node

Here's a bug you only notice under load. The Bun agent runs one central task, its command loop. A `select!` block waits on several things at once: incoming commands, a health-check timer that fires every second, snapshot requests from the cluster, and a shutdown signal. Whichever fires first wins; the loop handles it, then goes back to waiting. Simple, and for most commands it's fine, because most commands are fast.

Deploy is not fast. Pulling an image can take tens of seconds. Init containers run to completion before the main container starts. A rolling redeploy waits for each new replica to report healthy before it retires an old one. And all of that used to run *inside* the command loop, because `handle_command` awaited the whole `deploy` call before returning to the `select!`.

Think about what that means. While one app is pulling a 400MB image, the health-check timer is firing into a loop that can't answer it. Another app goes unhealthy and needs a restart? It waits. A `relish status` call? It waits. A second `apply`? It queues behind the first and can't even *start* until the pull finishes. One slow deploy freezes the whole node. On a busy cluster, that's the difference between a deploy and an outage.

The fix is to get the blocking work off the loop. Each deploy now runs on its own spawned task:

```rust
let worker = DeployWorker {
    grill: self.supervisor.grill().clone(),
    ops: DeployOps { tx: self.deploy_ops_tx.clone() },
};
tokio::spawn(async move {
    worker.run_deploy(config, forward_tx).await;
});
```

`tokio::spawn` hands a future to the runtime to run concurrently, the way you'd start a goroutine in Go or a thread in C — except it's cooperative, not pre-emptive, so it only ever yields at an `.await`. The command loop spawns the worker and returns to its `select!` immediately. The image pull now happens on the worker's task, and while it's parked at that `.await`, the loop is free to answer health checks, restarts, status, and further deploys. Two deploys for different apps land at once? Two tasks, both making progress. A second deploy for the same namespace/name is refused before either worker can race the same supervisor rows.

Spawning fixed responsiveness but created another observability problem: the SSE
stream used to be the only place an in-flight deploy existed. Close your terminal
and the evidence vanished. Now the agent registers a `DeployOperation` before it
spawns the worker. The first standalone SSE item is `Accepted { operation_id }`;
the worker advances the shared record through app, job and route-rebuild phases,
including its current target. `GET /v1/deploys/active` reads those records and
`GET /v1/deploys/operations` adds the newest fifty terminal results.

The forwarding task keeps consuming worker events even after the client drops.
`Complete` records `completed`, `Error` records `failed`, and a channel which
closes without either records `unknown`. Why not assume the worker succeeded?
Because absence of evidence is the exact condition diagnostics need to flag.
The operation history is local runtime evidence; the per-app spec history used
by rollback is a different structure, and the library-side `DeployState` model
doesn't magically become the binary's execution path just because both contain
the word “deploy”.

But here's the catch, and it's the whole design problem. The blocking I/O — `grill.create`, `grill.start`, the init and health polls — can move to the worker, because the grill and the port allocator are cheap to clone (both wrap their real state in an `Arc`, so a clone shares it). The *supervisor state machine* cannot. There is exactly one supervisor, it lives on the command loop behind `&mut self`, and it must stay that way: it's the single source of truth for which instances exist and what state each is in. Health checks read it. Crash restarts mutate it. If a deploy task held its own copy, the two would drift, and drift in a state machine is how you get an instance the health checker thinks is running and the supervisor thinks was never born.

So we split the work by who's allowed to touch what. The worker owns the slow grill I/O. Every state transition, every supervisor mutation, every service-map and networking change travels back to the loop as a message:

```rust
enum DeployOp {
    PrepareFreshInstance { /* … */ reply: oneshot::Sender<Result<PreparedInstance, BunError>> },
    ApplyEgressPreStart  { /* … */ reply: oneshot::Sender<Result<(), BunError>> },
    TransitionState      { instance_id: InstanceId, to: ContainerState,
                           reply: oneshot::Sender<Result<(), BunError>> },
    FinishFreshInstance  { /* … */ reply: oneshot::Sender<Result<(), BunError>> },
    // … one variant per authoritative step
}
```

Each variant carries its arguments and a `oneshot::Sender` — a single-use channel the loop replies down. The worker sends an op, awaits the reply, and drives on. The loop drains these ops in a new `select!` arm, right next to the command and health-check arms, and dispatches each to the same `&mut self` method the old serial code called. No logic moved; only *where it runs* changed.

Trace a fresh instance and you can see the two halves take turns:

```rust
// worker (off the loop)                    // loop (owns the supervisor)
let prepared = self.ops
    .prepare_fresh_instance(…).await?;   // → Preparing, build OCI spec, decrypt secrets
self.grill.create(…).await?;             // the image pull — off the loop
self.ops.apply_egress_pre_start(…).await?; // → program egress before anything runs (#86)
// … init containers, polled here …
self.ops.transition_state(…, Starting).await?;
self.grill.start(…).await?;              // start — off the loop
let ip = self.grill.container_ip(…).await;
self.ops.finish_fresh_instance(…, ip).await?; // → HealthWait, register backend, networking
```

The worker sequences the deploy; the loop applies each authoritative step and stays free between them. Because the loop processes deploy ops in the *same* `select!` as health checks, a slow pull on one app never delays a health transition on another — the pull is parked on a task, and the loop is doing other work. That ordering — create, *then* program egress, *then* start — is exactly the pre-start networking sequence from Chapter 3, preserved to the letter: a replacement replica must never run ahead of its egress policy, off-loop or not.

Two tests pin the behaviour down. The first deploys an app whose `create` sleeps for three seconds, then fires a `Status` command and asserts it's answered in well under that — proof the loop kept moving. The second starts two deploys whose creates both sleep, and checks that *both* creates are in flight before either finishes; serially, the second couldn't start until the first returned. Both tests fail against the old inline deploy and pass against the task-per-deploy one, which is exactly what you want a regression test to do.

## One config, two front doors, one path

A Reliaburger config file describes more than apps. It can declare namespaces (with resource budgets), permissions (who can do what), jobs, and image builds — all in the same TOML. And there are two ways to get that file into the cluster. You can run `relish apply` by hand, or you can commit it to a git repo and let the Lettuce GitOps engine sync it. Same file, two front doors.

Here's the question that keeps you up at night: do those two doors lead to the same room? If `relish apply` writes an app but silently drops the namespace, while GitOps writes the namespace but mangles the app's identity, then "declarative" is a lie. The cluster's state depends on *how* you applied the config, not *what's in it*. That's the worst kind of bug, because it only shows up when someone switches from one door to the other and wonders why their quota vanished.

For a long time, that was exactly the situation. Manual apply proposed an `AppSpec` for each app and dropped everything else on the floor. GitOps had its own translation step, `resource_change_to_request`, which returned `None` for anything that wasn't an app — jobs, namespaces, permissions, all silently skipped. Two code paths, two sets of blind spots, and no reason to think they'd ever agree.

The fix is structural, not a patch. We wrote one function, `config_to_desired_writes`, that turns a parsed `Config` into the ordered list of Raft writes it implies:

```rust
pub fn config_to_desired_writes(config: &Config) -> Vec<RaftRequest> {
    let mut writes = Vec::new();
    for (name, spec) in &config.namespace {
        writes.push(RaftRequest::NamespaceSpec { name: name.clone(), spec: Box::new(spec.clone()) });
    }
    for (name, spec) in &config.permission {
        writes.push(RaftRequest::PermissionSpec { name: name.clone(), spec: Box::new(spec.clone()) });
    }
    for (name, spec) in &config.app {
        let namespace = spec.namespace.clone().unwrap_or_else(|| "default".into());
        writes.push(RaftRequest::AppSpec { app_id: AppId::new(name, &namespace), spec: Box::new(spec.clone()) });
    }
    writes
}
```

`Box<T>` here is Rust's heap pointer — the same idea as a C `malloc`'d struct behind a pointer, but the compiler frees it for you when the `Box` goes out of scope. We box the specs because `RaftRequest` is an enum, and an enum is as big as its largest variant; boxing the big payloads keeps the whole enum small to move around. `Vec<T>` is a growable array, like Go's slice or C++'s `std::vector`.

Now both front doors call this one function. Manual apply loops over its output and writes each request. GitOps, after diffing the repo against the current state, maps each change through the *same* request shapes. There's no second translation that could drift, because there's no second translation. Notice the ordering, too: namespaces first, then permissions, then apps. A namespace's quota has to be committed before an app schedules against it, or the app's first placement races the budget that's meant to constrain it.

How do you *prove* the two doors agree? You write the test that would have caught the old divergence:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn manual_apply_and_gitops_converge_identically() {
    // Apply the every-kind config by hand to one council…
    for request in config_to_desired_writes(&config) {
        manual.write(request).await.unwrap();
    }
    let manual_state = declarative_json(&manual.desired_state().await);
    // …and sync the identical file through GitOps to another.
    // Then assert the declarative desired state is byte-identical.
}
```

The first time we ran it, it failed — and it failed for a *real* reason. Manual apply keyed an app on its declared namespace (`prod/web`), but the GitOps path hardcoded `default` when it built the app's identity. Same config, two different `AppId`s, two different rooms. The shared write function fixed the manual side; the GitOps translation had to learn to read the app's own namespace instead of assuming `default`. That's the whole point of an acceptance test written against the property you care about: it doesn't care *how* the paths differ, only *that* they agree, so it catches drift you didn't think to look for.

## Why "applied" must mean "all of it applied"

GitOps has a second failure mode that's subtler and nastier. A sync isn't one write; it's a batch. A single commit might add a namespace, update a permission, and create three apps. What happens if the second write fails?

The old runner applied each change in a loop, logged failures, and then — regardless of what failed — recorded the commit as applied:

```rust
// old: apply each change, then unconditionally advance the commit
for change in &outcome.changes {
    if let Err(e) = council.write(request).await { eprintln!("failed: {e}"); }
}
sync_state.last_applied_commit = Some(commit);   // ← runs even after a failure
```

Read that again, because it's the bug. `last_applied_commit` is how GitOps knows what it's already done. On the next tick, it fetches the repo, sees the commit hasn't changed, and skips — "already applied, nothing to do." So if a write failed but the commit advanced anyway, that failed resource is now *permanently* missing. It won't retry, because as far as the runner knows, it's done. The namespace you committed just quietly doesn't exist, and nothing ever tries again until some *unrelated* future commit happens to touch the repo.

The fix is a rule you can state in one sentence: the commit advances only if every write in the sync succeeds.

```rust
async fn apply_changes(council: &CouncilNode, changes: &[ResourceChange]) -> Result<usize, String> {
    let mut applied = 0;
    for change in changes {
        let Some(request) = change_to_request(change) else { continue };
        if let Err(e) = council.write(request).await {
            return Err(change_id(change).to_string());   // stop; don't advance
        }
        applied += 1;
    }
    Ok(applied)
}
```

`Result<usize, String>` is Rust's answer to error handling — a value that's *either* an `Ok` carrying the count, *or* an `Err` carrying the id of the change that failed. There's no exception to forget to catch and no error code to ignore; the caller can't get at the count without acknowledging the failure case. The `let Some(x) = … else { continue }` is a *let-else*: bind `x` if the pattern matches, otherwise run the `else` (which must diverge — here, `continue` to the next change). It's the clean way to say "skip the ones that don't map to a write" without nesting.

The caller advances `last_applied_commit` only on `Ok`. On `Err`, it leaves the commit untouched and moves on; the next tick sees an unapplied commit and re-runs the whole set. That only works because the writes are idempotent — applying a `NamespaceSpec` that's already there is an upsert, a harmless no-op — so re-running a partially-applied sync converges instead of double-counting. Idempotence is what buys you "just retry the whole thing," which is the simplest correct recovery there is.

The test for this drives `apply_changes` against a council that was never made leader, so every write is refused. The function must stop at the first failure and report *which* change failed, and the app must never reach desired state. Run it against the old code and the commit advances over a wholesale failure; run it against the new code and the failure surfaces, the commit holds, and the next tick gets another go.

## The namespace bug that got away

We fixed the identity mismatch on the *write* side and celebrated. Then someone deleted an app from git and watched the wrong one disappear.

Here's what we missed. The diff engine compares the repo against the current state to work out what changed, and to find *removals* it asks "which apps are in Raft but not in git?" The trouble was how it answered. It keyed everything on the bare app name:

```rust
let current_by_name: BTreeMap<String, _> =
    current.apps.iter().map(|(id, spec)| (id.name.clone(), (id, spec))).collect();
```

Drop `id.namespace` on the floor and `prod/web` and `default/web` collapse into one key, `web`. So when git stopped mentioning `prod/web`, the diff couldn't tell which `web` to remove, and a removal aimed at `prod` could take out `default` instead. We'd fixed the door the app *walks in* through and left the door it *leaves* by broken.

The fix is to diff on the whole identity, never the name alone. Git apps get keyed by the same `AppId` the write path builds:

```rust
let git_apps: BTreeMap<AppId, &AppSpec> = git_config
    .app
    .iter()
    .map(|(name, spec)| (app_id_for(name, spec), spec))
    .collect();

for app_id in current.apps.keys() {
    if !git_apps.contains_key(app_id) {
        changes.push(ResourceChange::Remove { resource_id: app_resource_id(app_id) });
    }
}
```

And the `resource_id` a change carries now spells out the full identity — `app.prod/web`, not `app.web` — so by the time the runner turns it into an `AppDelete`, there's no namespace left to guess. `app_resource_id` and `parse_app_resource_id` are exact inverses; encode an `AppId`, parse it back, get the same `AppId`. The test seeds two same-named apps in different namespaces, drops one from git, and checks that exactly the right one is reconciled away while its twin is left alone.

While we were in there, we killed a related zombie. Jobs were being compared against a set that was *always empty*:

```rust
let current_job_names: BTreeSet<&String> = BTreeSet::new();  // never filled
for name in git_config.job.keys() {
    if !current_job_names.contains(name) { /* always true → always "Add" */ }
}
```

Every sync re-declared every job as new. But jobs run to completion; they aren't reconciled desired state, and there's no job map in Raft to compare against. So the applier quietly dropped these phantom "Adds" while the summary counted them anyway — every sync claimed it added jobs it never wrote. The honest fix is to emit nothing for jobs at all. A job that's present in git is dispatched by the one-shot deploy path; one that's absent was never desired state to re-add. Silence is the correct diff.

## A webhook the whole internet can reach

Polling git every thirty seconds works, but it's slow and wasteful. Every git host will happily *tell* you the moment something changes, if you give it a URL to POST to. So Lettuce exposes one: `POST /v1/gitops/webhook`. Push to the repo, GitHub fires the hook, and the sync runs in the second it takes to deliver, not on the next poll.

There's an obvious problem. Every other route on the agent sits behind a bearer token — you prove who you are, or you get a 401. But GitHub has never heard of your bearer token and never will. It authenticates *its* way: an HMAC-SHA256 signature over the request body, in an `X-Hub-Signature-256` header, computed with a secret you configured on both ends. GitLab does its own thing (`X-Gitlab-Token`, the shared secret sent verbatim). Neither will send a Reliaburger token, so a route that demands one is a route no git host can call.

So the webhook has to be *public* — exempt from the bearer-auth middleware — and yet it can't be *open*, because an unauthenticated "make the cluster sync now" button is a denial-of-service lever anyone on the internet can lean on. The resolution is to move the authentication *into the handler*. The router puts the route on the public side of the split, alongside health and the join endpoint:

```rust
let public = Router::new()
    .route("/v1/health", get(health_handler))
    .route("/v1/cluster/join", post(join_handler))
    .route("/v1/gitops/webhook", post(gitops_webhook_handler))  // public, but HMAC-gated
    .with_state(state.clone());
```

and the handler does the checking itself, over the raw bytes of the body, before it nudges anything:

```rust
async fn gitops_webhook_handler(
    State(state): State<ApiState>,
    headers: HeaderMap,
    body: axum::body::Bytes,
) -> Response {
    let Some(validator) = &state.gitops_webhook_validator else {
        return service_unavailable("webhook secret not configured");  // fail closed
    };
    let mut guard = validator.lock().await;
    match guard.validate(&body, signature, delivery_id, branch) {
        Ok(_)  => { let _ = tx.send(()).await; accepted() }
        Err(e) => unauthorized_or_rate_limited(e),
    }
}
```

Three checks, in order. The signature must verify against the configured secret — `ring::hmac::verify` does this in constant time, so a wrong signature leaks nothing about how close it was. The delivery id must be one we haven't seen, or a replayed POST (the same signed body, captured and re-sent) would trigger a fresh sync every time. And the request must fit under a rate limit, so a flood of valid hooks can't hammer the sync loop. Only when all three pass does the handler send `()` down the channel to wake the runner.

Two design choices are worth pausing on. First, **fail closed**: if no `[gitops] webhook_secret` is configured, there's no validator, and the handler returns 503 rather than triggering an unauthenticated sync. A public route with no way to authenticate the caller is worse than no route at all. Second, the validator is `Arc<Mutex<WebhookValidator>>` — shared and *mutable*, because the replay set and the rate-limit window are state that changes on every request. `Mutex` here isn't guarding against data races in the C sense; it's making sure two hooks arriving at once can't both slip past the "have I seen this delivery id?" check. Rust's type system won't let you mutate shared state without saying how you're synchronising it, so the `Mutex` is the compiler asking you to be explicit, and the right answer.

The tests exercise the whole contract with no bearer token in sight: a bad signature is a 401 and triggers no sync (observed by an empty channel), a missing signature is a 401, a replayed delivery id is a 401 the second time, a rate-limit flood is a 429, and a correctly-signed GitHub-shaped POST is a 202 that *does* nudge the channel. That last one is the point of the whole exercise — a real git host, sending exactly what it sends, gets through.

## Refuses to be tricked by a filename

Lettuce shells out to `git`. That's a deliberate choice — the `git` binary is always on the node, and it beats pulling in a large C library — but shelling out to a tool that takes both options and arguments on one line has a classic hazard. What if a branch name, a path, or a commit SHA begins with a dash?

```
git log -1 --format=... --upload-pack=/tmp/evil
```

If that `--upload-pack=…` came from a value you thought was a commit SHA, you've just handed `git` an option it will cheerfully obey. The repo URL, the branch, the path prefix, the SHA — several of these are ultimately attacker-influenceable, and none of them should ever be read as a flag.

Git gives you two separators for exactly this. `--` says "everything after me is a pathspec, not an option." `--end-of-options` (git 2.24+) says "stop parsing options, but still treat what follows as revisions." They're not interchangeable: a commit SHA passed after `--` is read as a *filename*, which is wrong, so revision-carrying commands (`log`, `rev-parse`, `ls-tree`, `show`) get `--end-of-options`, while the pathspec on `fetch` gets `--`.

```rust
Command::new("git")
    .args(["log", "-1", "--format=%H%n%s%n%an%n%ct", "--end-of-options"])
    .arg(sha)   // even if it starts with '-', it's a revision now, not a flag
```

One subtlety cost us a test. `git rev-parse --end-of-options HEAD` *echoes the separator back* into its output, because rev-parse prints any token it can't resolve as a revision. Add `--verify` and it prints only the resolved SHA — or fails cleanly — which is what we wanted anyway. The test feeds a leading-dash "SHA" and a leading-dash path into the real functions and asserts they resolve to nothing rather than executing an option. Nothing dramatic happens, which is exactly the success condition.

The same wrapper learned two more manners. A clone left over at the data path is now *checked* before it's reused — its `remote.origin.url` and tracked branch must still match the config — because a stale clone from a repointed `[gitops] repo`, or one left behind by a failover, would otherwise sync the wrong repository entirely. On a mismatch, Lettuce discards it and clones fresh. And the file merge, which used to `HashMap::extend` files in whatever order the hash felt like, now sorts by path first: two nodes handed the identical repo must converge on the identical config, and "last writer wins by hash order" is not a property you can reason about. A resource declared twice across files is reported as a duplicate against the later file rather than silently overwritten.

The listing itself uses `git ls-tree -r`, which always descends into subdirectories. For a while `[gitops]` still accepted a `recursive` flag that did nothing, and `recursive = false` earned a startup warning because it promised a shallow sync it never delivered. We kept it "so existing configs still parse". Before 0.1.0 there are no existing configs worth a shim, so the field is gone. `GitOpsConfig` has `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so a leftover `recursive = ...` is now a parse error that names the key, which is louder and more honest than a warning scrolling past in the Bun log.

## A broken sync you can actually see

The last gap was quieter than the others, which is what made it dangerous. When a sync failed — the remote was unreachable, a commit didn't verify, a write was refused — the runner printed to stderr and moved on. Nothing in the cluster state changed. So `relish` and the dashboard, which read `SyncState` out of Raft, showed a sync that looked perfectly healthy while it had in fact been failing every thirty seconds for an hour.

Now every hard failure is recorded where the tools can see it:

```rust
async fn record_failure(council: &CouncilNode, desired: &DesiredState, error: &str) {
    let mut sync_state = desired.gitops_sync_state.clone().unwrap_or_default();
    sync_state.phase = SyncPhase::Error;
    sync_state.last_error = Some(error.to_string());
    sync_state.consecutive_failures = sync_state.consecutive_failures.saturating_add(1);
    sync_state.last_attempt_at = Some(now_millis());
    council.write(RaftRequest::GitOpsSyncUpdate(Box::new(sync_state))).await.ok();
}
```

`saturating_add` is worth a word for anyone coming from C: it adds, but clamps at the type's maximum instead of wrapping around to zero. A counter that silently resets to zero after enough failures would be a lie of its own, so we never let it overflow.

The failure count does double duty. It feeds a *back-off*: instead of retrying a broken remote every poll interval and tight-looping against a dead server, the runner waits `poll × 2^failures`, capped, before the next attempt. The `backoff_delay` function was already written and tested — it just had no caller. Wiring it in is the difference between a sync loop that degrades gracefully and one that spins. When a sync finally succeeds, the count resets to zero, the error clears, and the applied commit advances (the atomicity rule from earlier).

Success also stamps the *coordinator*: the runner elects a GitOps coordinator from the council membership and records who it is, so the UI can show which node is meant to be driving syncs. The election prefers a non-leader to spread load, falling back to the leader on a single node. It *complements* the leader rather than replacing it, because only the leader can write to Raft — so the leader still drives the sync, and the coordinator field is a signpost, not a second scheduler. That's a deliberate scope choice, documented here so the next person doesn't go looking for a coordinator that runs the loop.

The test points the runner at a repo path that doesn't exist and waits for `SyncState` to carry a non-empty `last_error` and a non-zero failure count. Before the fix, it would wait forever: the failure never left stderr.

## Namespaces that actually say no

There's a nice pay-off from making namespaces real desired state. Back when we built the scheduler, it already had a quota ledger — a per-namespace accountant that checks whether admitting an app would bust its CPU, memory, GPU, or replica budget. It was wired, tested, and completely inert, because it was fed an empty table: namespaces weren't desired state yet, so there were no budgets to enforce.

Now they are. The scheduling pass builds its ledger straight from the desired-state namespaces:

```rust
let mut quotas = crate::meat::quota::ledger_from_namespaces(&desired.namespaces);
```

Declare a namespace with `cpu = "2000m"`, apply an app that wants three replicas at 800 millicores each, and the scheduler does the arithmetic — 2,400 > 2,000 — and refuses the placement with a clear reason in the log, instead of over-committing the budget you set. A namespace with headroom admits the same app without complaint. The enforcement was built and proven long ago; all this theme did was hand it the numbers.

## A deploy owns what it starts

A later audit went looking for every place where a deploy said "done" before it was. There were a lot of them, and they all had the same shape: a step reported success, and something (a process, a port, a file, a route) was left with nobody responsible for it. So the rule we settled on is simple to say. A deploy *owns* everything it starts: the replacement containers, their ports, their on-disk adoption records, their routes. It keeps each of those in the supervisor until it has seen, with its own eyes, that the thing is gone. A failure never releases ownership; it just stops the deploy and leaves the leftovers where Stop or Retire can find them.

Start with the hole the stop listing above left open. Here's what the retire path uses now:

```rust
/// Preserve ownership until both force-kill and observed runtime exit succeed.
async fn kill_runtime_instance<G: Grill>(
    grill: &G,
    id: &InstanceId,
    confirmation_timeout: std::time::Duration,
) -> Result<(), BunError> {
    tokio::time::timeout(confirmation_timeout, grill.kill(id))
        .await
        .map_err(|_| BunError::StopUnconfirmed {
            instance_id: id.clone(),
            reason: "force-kill request timed out",
        })??;
    if observe_runtime_exit(grill, id, confirmation_timeout).await? {
        return Ok(());
    }
    Err(BunError::StopUnconfirmed {
        instance_id: id.clone(),
        reason: "runtime did not confirm exit after force-kill",
    })
}
```

That `??` looks like a typo, but it isn't. `tokio::time::timeout` wraps a future and gives back a `Result` of its own: `Err(Elapsed)` if time ran out, otherwise `Ok(...)` containing whatever the inner future returned, which is another `Result`. So we have `Result<Result<(), BunError>, Elapsed>`. The `map_err` turns the outer error into a `BunError`, the first `?` unwraps the timeout layer, and the second `?` unwraps `kill`'s own result. Either failure returns early. The trailing `observe_runtime_exit` asks the runtime again, because a successful signal isn't a stopped process. Rolling, blue-green, rollback and plain `relish stop` all go through this helper, so they can't drift apart again.

How long should Bun wait for the runtime? The first version hard-coded two seconds, and CI caught it out. On a busy runner `runc kill` alone took longer than that: it's a fork and exec of a Go binary that reads its state file and signals through the kernel, and every one of those steps queues behind whatever else the host is doing. A process stuck in uninterruptible I/O doesn't even die on `SIGKILL` until the I/O completes. The stop wasn't wrong, just slow, and Bun reported "stop not confirmed" and kept ownership of a container that was about to exit anyway. So the deadline is now `[runtime] stop_confirmation_timeout_secs`, read once at startup and threaded down to every stop and kill. It defaults to ten seconds, five times the budget CI outran. We didn't go higher because some of these waits run on the agent's command loop, which can spend up to two deadlines on one wedged instance (the kill request, then the exit check), and twenty seconds still sits inside the thirty-second window before a council marks a silent node's report stale. A test gives `MockGrill` a five-second kill and checks the default waits it out, while a two-second deadline still reports the stop as unconfirmed.

When it fails, the deploy worker emits an error instead of `Complete`, and both generations stay in ordinary supervision. The same goes for everything after the process exits. Deleting the identity directory and the adoption record returns `Result<(), BunError>` over the command channel. `()` is Rust's unit type (think `void`, but as a real value), so success carries no payload and failure explains which instance still has work outstanding. Only when both deletions succeed do we release the port and forget the instance. Rollback follows the same rule, and history tells the truth about it: `RolledBack` only when every replacement is confirmed gone, `Halted` when some old instances had already retired, `Failed` when cleanup couldn't be confirmed.

Several smaller races had the same flavour:

- **An error event isn't the end.** The worker reports an error *before* it rolls back. Releasing the app's deploy lock at that moment let a corrective deploy start while the old worker was still killing containers. Two owners, one workload. The observer now waits on the worker task's `JoinHandle` (the Tokio equivalent of joining a thread) before it writes history and releases the lock. A panicked worker is recorded as `Unknown`, whatever it said earlier.
- **Cancel is a request.** `relish cancel-deploy <id>` signals a `CancellationToken` and waits for the worker to notice. The worker checks it at safe points: health waits are read-only, so `tokio::select!` can abandon them, but a `create`, `start` or cleanup call always finishes first. The operation becomes `Cancelled` only after the worker returns. It cancels one node's attempt and doesn't touch Raft's desired state, so apply the corrected config too.
- **Tell the restart driver first.** Between our `kill` and our observing the exit, the one-second crash detector could see an instance marked `Running` exit unexpectedly and restart it. The worker now sends `BeginRetire`, which marks the instance `Stopping` and turns off retries, before it signals anything.
- **Names must not collide.** An app and a job called `web` in the same namespace both mapped to `default__web-0`, so config validation now requires distinct names. An app called `worker-g1` could collide with generation one of `worker`, so fresh deploys check every proposed ID against existing owners. After a self-upgrade, the generation counter restarts in memory, so it now starts above every adopted instance's generation, using checked arithmetic that errors instead of wrapping. Each generation also gets its own cgroup (`web/0`, `web/g7-0`): when two generations shared one, removing the old group stopped the new container as well.
- **Routes are confirmed before they're published.** The replacement's backend goes into the kernel map first; only if that works does the new map reach DNS and Wrapper. The map has 32 backend slots per app; replica 33 used to fail with a log line while the deploy reported `Complete`. Now it's a deploy error. Ordinary stops and automatic restarts also drain in-flight requests the way a rollout does.
- **Keep the evidence cleanup needs.** Finalising a rollout rebuilds the app's local service entry: unregister it, then register it again against the council's committed allocation. If `relish stop` lands mid-rollout, the council has already withdrawn that allocation, so the second step refuses, and the first has thrown away the entry the retained replacement's cleanup needs. Bun only releases a container address once the live service map proves its backend is gone (see [Writing it down before doing it](03-talking-to-each-other.md#writing-it-down-before-doing-it)), and with no entry there's nothing to prove it against. The orchestrator retried the stop on every two-second tick, failing with "original service withdrawal is unproven" each time. It took a crash, a recovery that redeployed and a badly timed stop to hit, which is why it showed up in CI once and never in eight runs in the VM. Finalisation now keeps a `clone()` of the map from before the rebuild and puts it back if the rebuild refuses. Rust never copies heap data behind your back, so `clone()` is an explicit deep copy; for a few dozen services it's cheap, and much simpler than undoing a half-finished rebuild step by step.
- **Replacements are recorded before they serve.** A replacement's adoption record is written before its health wait, so a bun that dies mid-rollout adopts it instead of leaking it. Replacements now run their init containers too; they used to skip them.

Most of these were found by tests that hold a runtime call open (a `kill` that doesn't return, a `create` that hangs) and then poke the agent from another direction. When every mock call returns instantly, you never see the interleavings. What they don't prove is recovery from a power cut mid-rollout; we test controlled interruption, not arbitrary crashes.

## Jobs that might already have run

Apps are easy to recover: if a web server's fate is unclear, you start it again. Jobs aren't. A job that sends invoices, migrates a schema or charges a card must not run twice just because bun crashed at an awkward moment. So bun records each attempt in a durable checkpoint, and it's honest about what it doesn't know:

```rust
pub(super) enum JobPhase {
    /// Budget claimed before create; execution has not been authorised.
    Preparing,
    /// Runtime preparation completed and execution was authorised durably.
    Launching,
    /// The runtime reported an actual exit status.
    Exited {
        /// Observed process exit code, including zero for success.
        code: i32,
    },
    /// The attempt may have run, but its outcome cannot be established.
    Unknown,
    /// Operator stop intent; retirement must still be confirmed.
    Stopping,
    /// Operator stop completed without authorising another automatic retry.
    Stopped,
}
```

(`pub(super)` makes the enum visible to the parent module, `bun`, and nowhere else; it's finer-grained than Go's upper-case export rule.) After a restart, bun adopts a job that's still running. A job that has gone, with an exit code the runtime can still report, becomes `Exited`. Anything else caught in `Preparing` or `Launching` becomes `Unknown`, and stays that way. Bun never guesses "probably failed, let's retry".

`relish apply` refuses to start a job whose previous outcome is unknown, and says why: `previous outcome is unknown; use apply --rerun-jobs for an explicit rerun`. `--rerun-jobs` is the human saying "I've checked, run it again". The API accepts it only from a user with the Deployer role, and only for a file containing nothing but non-scheduled jobs. GitOps and the reconciler never set it. Cron jobs are the one exception: once bun has confirmed the old run's container is gone, the next scheduled occurrence runs normally. That's a new occurrence, not a replay of the uncertain one. Chapter 8 covers the retry budget and the crash tests behind this.

## Stop means stop, delete means delete

For most of the project `relish stop web` in a cluster did two things: it deleted `web` from desired state through Raft, and it stopped the leader's own replica on the spot. Both sound reasonable. Together they made a trap. The leader's placement reconciler still had `web` recorded as converged, so when the V02 soak ran `relish stop` and then applied the same file a few seconds later, the reconciler saw the same specification come back and skipped it. The app stayed down. And there was no way at all to remove an app, short of GitOps.

Now there are two commands with two meanings. `relish stop` writes `AppStop`, which keeps the specification and puts the app in `stopped_apps`; the scheduler treats a stopped app as an override of zero replicas, and every node's reconciler retires its instances the ordinary way, the leader's included. Applying the app clears the mark. `relish delete` writes `AppDelete`, which removes it altogether. Neither reaches past a reconciler to stop a container itself, so the bookkeeping that decides what to redeploy is never out of step with what runs.

Keeping the specification had a side effect we missed. Every node's routing table gets the cluster's ingress routes from the leader, built by walking the apps in desired state, and a stopped app is still in there. So its route stayed, with no backends behind it, and the proxy answered its host with 503 instead of 404. The next soak pulse caught it: `ingress_removes_route_after_stop` waited five minutes for a 404 that never came. `cluster_ingress` now skips anything in `stopped_apps`:

```rust
desired
    .apps
    .iter()
    .filter(|(id, _)| !desired.stopped_apps.contains(*id))
```

`filter` hands the closure a reference to each `(key, value)` pair, so `id` is a `&&AppId` there; `*id` strips one layer to get the `&AppId` that `contains` wants. A stopped app keeps its service and VIP, though, with zero backends, so the same name and address come back when you apply it again.

## Two seconds is too eager

Each node's placement reconciler polls the leader every couple of seconds and deploys whatever its share of the placements says. If a deploy failed, the next poll simply tried again. Kubernetes has `CrashLoopBackOff` for exactly this; we had a supervisor back-off for instances that crash after starting, but a deploy that never produces a running instance never reaches the supervisor. The V02 soak found the result: an app whose binary had been truncated by a power cut reached generation `g170` in eight minutes, every attempt a fresh container, a fresh journal entry and a fresh log line.

`DeployBackoff` remembers consecutive failures per placement and the specification they were for. The same specification waits 5 s, then 10, 20, 40, up to five minutes; a changed specification is new desired state and is tried at once, with the count reset. Success clears the record, and so does the leader withdrawing the placement. Eight minutes of a broken app is now a handful of attempts, and the journal says when the next one is due.

## A stubborn process shouldn't freeze the node either

We moved deploys off the command loop and thought we were done. The V02 soak disagreed. Its journals filled with `agent status timed out`, `snapshot collection failed or timed out` every five seconds, and `retirement of … exceeded ten seconds; ownership retained`, all on a node that was doing nothing more exciting than retiring a few apps.

The apps were `busybox sleep` and `httpd`. Run as PID 1, both ignore SIGTERM, and so do plenty of shell scripts. That's fine as far as correctness goes: the stop sends SIGTERM, waits out the ten-second grace, sends SIGKILL and confirms the exit. The trouble was *where* it waited. `Stop` and `Retire` still ran inside `handle_command`, so the loop sat in that grace for ten seconds per app. Status requests timed out behind it (their limit is five seconds). The report worker gave up. A second retirement queued behind the first, and a third behind that. A burst of stubborn retirements made the node deaf for tens of seconds.

The fix follows the deploy worker's rule: slow waiting moves to a task, and every state change stays on the loop. A stop now has three parts:

1. `begin_app_stop` runs on the loop. It retires the schedule, withdraws the app's routing and moves its instances to `Stopping`. Nothing's been signalled yet.
2. `app_exit_wait` builds a future that owns clones of everything it needs (the grill, the drain tracker, the grace) and borrows nothing from the agent. It drains each replica, sends SIGTERM, waits out the grace and escalates to SIGKILL, for every replica at once.
3. `finish_app_stop` runs on the loop again, once the wait reports back. It records `Stopped`, commits job phases and releases the instances' artifacts and discovery keys. A retirement then forgets ownership, and a lease retirement removes its test storage.

The signature of the middle step is where Rust earns its keep:

```rust
fn app_exit_wait(
    &self,
    stop: &AppStop,
) -> impl std::future::Future<Output = Result<(), BunError>> + Send + 'static {
    // … clone the grill, the drains, the grace …
    async move {
        let waits = ids.iter().map(|id| {
            drain_and_stop_instance(&drains, &grill, id, grace, confirmation_timeout)
        });
        futures_util::future::join_all(waits)
            .await
            .into_iter()
            .find_map(Result::err)
            .map_or(Ok(()), Err)
    }
}
```

`'static` is the promise that the future holds no borrowed references, so it can outlive the call that made it. If the `async move` block had quietly captured `self`, the compiler would reject the signature, because `self` is only borrowed for the length of the call. In Go you'd find that mistake at run time, as a data race; here it doesn't build. `join_all` polls every replica's wait together, so three stubborn replicas cost one grace, not three.

The agent keeps these futures in a `tokio::task::JoinSet`, a set of spawned tasks you can await in completion order, and the loop's `select!` gains one arm:

```rust
Some(outcome) = self.stop_waits.join_next_with_id(),
    if !self.stop_waits.is_empty() => {
    self.complete_app_stop(outcome).await;
}
```

The `if` after the future is a `select!` precondition: while nothing is stopping, the branch is switched off rather than polled. `join_next_with_id` hands back the finished task's id even when the task panicked, which is how the loop always finds the callers waiting on that stop, so nobody waits forever.

Moving the wait off the loop opened gaps that the old serial code closed by accident, because nothing else could run in the middle of a stop. Each one needed an explicit answer:

- **A second stop of the same app** joins the pending one. It doesn't signal again, and both callers get the outcome.
- **A deploy of an app that's still stopping** is refused with "still stopping; retry". The reconciler retries anyway, and a deploy mustn't replace instances that a stop still owns. The refusal covers the whole apply: a standalone `relish apply` of several apps fails if any one of them is still stopping, and goes through once that stop confirms.
- **Shutdown with stops pending** aborts the waits (shutdown SIGTERMs and kills everything itself) and tells each caller the stop was unconfirmed, so they keep what they own.
- **A crash mid-stop** leaves the instances owned and unconfirmed, exactly as before. In a cluster the reconciler still has them recorded, so it sends `Retire` again after the restart, and that stop starts over. A standalone `relish stop` has no reconciler behind it: if the agent crashes mid-stop, the request is lost, and you run `relish stop` again.
- **The egress fence**, which stops an app whose kernel egress policy has vanished, used to call the inline stop from the health tick, so it stalled the loop in exactly the same way. It now starts the same off-loop stop. If a stop is already pending for that app, the fence marks it instead, and if that stop then fails, its completion force-kills the app straight away rather than waiting for the next tick.

The agent was only half the stall. On each cycle the node's placement reconciler sent `Retire` for every app it no longer owned, one at a time, and gave each ten seconds for queueing and reply. That's the same ten seconds as the stop grace, so a stubborn app's retirement *always* timed out on the first try, and five of them held up the reconciler (and every deploy queued behind it) for fifty seconds. The deadline now comes from the stop itself: `stop_completion_bound` adds up the worst case (a drain of up to one grace, the grace, and three runtime confirmation timeouts), and the reconciler adds its queueing allowance on top. A cycle's retirements go through `buffer_unordered(4)`, a stream adaptor that keeps up to four futures in flight and yields each result as it lands, so five stubborn retirements cost about one grace, not five. A test with a stand-in agent whose every stop takes a grace checks that three retirements finish inside two graces, each on its first attempt; one at a time they took 4.5 s for three 1.5 s stops.

What didn't change is the guarantee that matters: a port, an address or a volume is released only after the runtime has confirmed the old process is gone. `Retire` still answers only after the exit, and the tests hold both ends of that. With a process-runtime workload running `sh -c "trap '' TERM; sleep 60"`, `Status` must answer in under a second while the stop waits, the stop must take at least the grace and end with the process gone, a retirement must keep its instance listed until the exit, and two stubborn stops must finish in under 1.8 graces (one after the other they can't take less than two). Each of those fails against the old loop. The overlap test, for example, reported `4.03s for two 2s graces`.

## What we deferred

Blue-green deploys, autoscaling, the Lettuce GitOps engine, and Kubernetes migration tools are all Phase 9. The `DeployPhase` enum already carries the blue-green states (you'll have spotted `StartingGreen` and friends in the transition tests), and `execute` delegates to a separate blue-green path — but we'll cover that in Chapter 9. Rolling deploys with automatic rollback cover the vast majority of production deployment needs, and they're the foundation everything else builds on.

Phase 7 adds 48 tests, bringing the total to 1047.

### Queueing a webhook is an observable operation

A valid signature doesn't prove the sync loop received a notification. The HTTP
handler used to discard a failed channel send and return 202 even after the
receiver had gone away. It now reserves queue capacity first and returns 503 if
the loop is unavailable or its queue is full. Only an authenticated, validated
delivery uses the reservation and receives “sync queued”.

The reservation also prevents an awkward retry bug. Validation records the
delivery ID for replay protection; doing that before discovering a full queue
would make the provider's retry look like a replay. We reserve before validation,
so a rejected delivery can be retried after capacity becomes available. Tests
close the receiver and fill the queue, then drain one slot and retry the same ID.
