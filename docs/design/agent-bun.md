## 1. Overview

Bun is the per-node agent that runs on every node in a Reliaburger cluster. It is not a separate binary -- it is the single `reliaburger` binary operating in agent mode. Every node runs the same binary, and every node runs Bun. There is no distinction between control plane nodes and worker nodes at the binary level; nodes acquire additional responsibilities (leader, council member, metrics aggregator) dynamically at runtime.

Bun's responsibilities on every node:

- **Container management (Grill):** Start, stop, health-check, and monitor OCI containers via the Grill abstraction layer. Grill drives the runtimes directly (runc on Linux, Apple Container on macOS, and a `process` mode with no runtime at all); it does not shell through containerd.
- **Process workload management:** Start, stop, and health-check non-container workloads (host binaries and inline scripts), gated by a deny-by-default binary allowlist. (The namespace/cgroup isolation stack for these host processes is planned; see §5.2.)
- **Port allocation:** Allocate ephemeral host ports from a configurable range (default 10000-60000) and map them to container-internal ports.
- **eBPF service discovery (Onion):** Load and maintain the Onion eBPF programs and kernel maps for socket-level service discovery and firewall enforcement.
- **Log collection (Ketchup):** Capture stdout/stderr from all workloads and feed them into the structured log pipeline.
- **Metrics collection (Mayo):** Scrape per-workload metrics endpoints and feed them into the time-series store.
- **Image registry node (Pickle):** Participate in the distributed, content-addressed image registry.
- **Gossip participation (Mustard):** Participate in the cluster-wide gossip mesh for failure detection and metadata propagation.
- **Ingress proxy (Wrapper):** Serve external HTTP/HTTPS traffic with TLS termination, routing, and health-check-aware load balancing.
- **Web UI (Brioche):** Serve the compiled-in web dashboard.
- **Secret decryption:** Decrypt `ENC[AGE:...]` values in memory and inject them as environment variables.
- **Certificate management:** Auto-renew node certificates (1-year lifetime), issue workload identity certificates via CSR to council members (1-hour lifetime, rotated every 30 minutes).
- **Volume management:** Create, snapshot, and enforce size limits on local persistent volumes.
- **Fault injection (Smoker):** Execute fault injection commands by writing to eBPF maps and cgroup controls.
- **Self-upgrade:** Stage, verify, and apply rolling binary upgrades with automatic rollback.
- **nftables management:** Maintain perimeter firewall rules (cluster boundary, management access, egress allowlists).
- **GPU detection:** Detect NVIDIA GPUs at startup (probe `/dev/nvidia0`, parse `nvidia-smi`) and report them as schedulable resources.

Grill is Bun's container runtime interface -- the abstraction layer between Bun's workload management logic and the underlying runtime. Grill handles OCI image unpacking, container creation, network namespace setup, cgroup configuration, port mapping, and stdio stream attachment. The name follows the Reliaburger convention: Grill is where containers get cooked.

> **Decision log — Grill drives runtimes directly, not via containerd.** An earlier draft (still visible in a few listings below, e.g. §2 and §4.1) had Grill talk to `containerd` over its gRPC socket. The shipped Grill has three concrete backends and no containerd dependency: `runc` on Linux (Grill writes the OCI bundle and drives foreground `runc run` plus the state/exec commands itself), Apple Container on macOS, and a `process` backend that runs a host binary with no OCI runtime at all. We dropped containerd because it duplicated the exact state Bun already keeps (which container is where, in what state) and added a socket, a gRPC dependency, and a second thing to keep alive under memory pressure — for a single-binary orchestrator that already reconciles container state on restart, the shim earned its keep nowhere. Where the text below says "containerd," read "the Grill backend for this node's runtime." References to state surviving Bun restarts still hold: `runc`'s own `state` and the Apple VM outlive Bun, and Grill re-adopts them on startup.

**0.1.0 process-mode scope (20 September 2026):** Native process workloads must
run in the foreground and keep all children in the supervised process group.
Daemonising, detached sessions/groups and hand-off to external service managers
are unsupported. Use Linux containers for those workloads. This is a cooperative
lifecycle contract, not containment. Production process mode uses a durable
foreground owner: intent precedes execution, and startup reconciles every launch
before adopting workloads or allowing replacements. Missing owners retain
uncertainty; completed jobs preserve their exit code even without an agent PID
record. C34 still tracks remaining runtime/discovery recovery and qualification.
The broader process-isolation design below remains future work.

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Single binary, no sidecar model.** Bun is not a separate process from the orchestrator -- it IS the orchestrator on this node. All subsystems (Grill, Onion, Ketchup, Mayo, Pickle, Mustard, Wrapper, Brioche) run as async tasks within the same Tokio runtime. This eliminates IPC overhead and version compatibility concerns between components.

2. **Containers survive Bun restarts.** Containers are managed by containerd/runc, which is independent of Bun. When Bun restarts (including during self-upgrade), it reconnects to running containers by querying the container runtime. Applications are never interrupted by Bun lifecycle events.

3. **Process workloads are first-class.** Process workloads (host binaries and inline scripts) receive the same isolation primitives as containers (cgroups, PID namespace, network namespace, mount namespace) minus the filesystem image. From the cluster's perspective, they are indistinguishable from container workloads in terms of scheduling, health checking, service discovery, and metrics.

4. **Sub-millisecond per-app overhead.** At the design goal of 500 apps per node, Bun must have sub-millisecond per-app overhead. This drives the choice of Rust (no GC pauses), eBPF (kernel-space interception, not userspace proxying), and direct cgroup/namespace manipulation (no shim processes per container).

5. **Deny-by-default security.** Process workloads require an explicit binary allowlist in `node.toml`: an `Exec` binary runs only if its absolute path is listed, a `Script` runs only if its interpreter (`/bin/sh`) is listed, and an empty or absent allowlist refuses every host workload. This admission gate — allowlist plus honest refusal — is the enforcement that ships today. The deeper isolation stack (Linux namespaces, seccomp, capability restriction, a dedicated `burger` unprivileged user) is **planned — not yet implemented**; see the status note in §5.2. Where isolation a node cannot provide is requested (e.g. mount isolation on a non-Linux host), the deploy is refused rather than run unprotected.

### 1.1 runc rootfs ownership

One unpacked OCI image generation can back many workloads, but it is never a
shared writable root. `ImageStore` owns the content-addressed `gen-*` directory.
For a rootful workload whose OCI root is writable, Grill mounts this layout:

```text
bundles/{instance}/rootfs         OverlayFS mountpoint passed to runc
bundles/{instance}/rootfs-upper   this instance's persisted writes
bundles/{instance}/rootfs-work    OverlayFS work directory
bundles/{instance}/rootfs-lower   canonical generation marker
images/.../gen-{hash}             shared lower layer owned by ImageStore
```

Read-only OCI roots can point directly at the generation. Writable roots can't.
The private upper remains across a restart of the same instance and across Bun
replacement, so adoption sees the running workload's files. If the image
generation changes, Grill clears that instance's old upper before mounting the
new lower. It never carries modifications from one image into another.

Mount ownership follows the workload lifecycle. A guard unmounts if preparation
returns an error or unwinds before the bundle becomes live. Natural exit, stop
timeout escalation, explicit kill and rejected adoption all converge on the
same cleanup path. Cleanup deletes stale runc state and releases the overlay,
port map and network namespace, but does not delete the shared lower. A real
rootful-runc suite covers two-replica isolation, restart persistence, failed
create rollback, process-death adoption and absence of leaked mountpoints.

### 1.2 Image config and the container user

Runc resolves each container's process against the image's verified config
blob, with Kubernetes rules: app `command` replaces `Entrypoint` (and drops
`Cmd`), app `args` replaces `Cmd`, image `Env` sits under the app's env (the
app wins), and image `WorkingDir` and `User` apply unless the app sets
`working_dir` or `run_as_user`/`run_as_group`. A named user or group is looked
up in the image's own `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`, following symlinks inside
the image only. The spec generator records the app's wishes in
`OciProcess::overrides`; runc consumes that field after the pull, so
`config.json` stays pure OCI. Process workloads and the Apple runtime ignore it
and run `command` followed by `args`.

Every rootful runc container runs in a user namespace (decision D1 of the
zero-to-cluster plan). Container ids `0..65536` map onto the node's range
`2000000000..2000065536`, so image root is an unprivileged host uid. The one
range is shared by every container on the node, like Docker's
`userns-remap`, which keeps the unpacked image cache shareable:

- `ImageStore::with_owner_shift` unpacks each layer entry with its uid and gid
  plus the base (restoring set-id bits `chown` clears), and gives directories
  the unpacker creates to container root. Shifted trees live in their own
  `gen-{hash}-owner-{base}` generation.
- The private overlay's upper directory copies the image root's owner and
  mode, since the overlay's `/` takes them from the upper.
- The container gets Docker's default capability set, which only acts on what
  the namespace owns.
- `/sys` is a read-only bind of the host's: a user namespace may not mount a
  fresh sysfs in a network namespace it doesn't own.
- The node-created network namespace sets
  `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0` and an open `ping_group_range`, so
  container root can bind port 80 without `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` over it.
- The workload identity directory is handed to the container user's host uid
  at create time, and Bun writes rotated identity files with the directory's
  owner.

Operators must keep `2000000000..2000065536` out of `/etc/subuid` and any
directory service. Rootless runc maps a single id, so every image user runs
as its container root there.

**Volume ownership.** A bind mount keeps host ownership, and a user-namespaced
process can only write what its mapped ids own. Before creating the container,
Bun resolves the process user (image `USER`, or `run_as_user`/`run_as_group`),
maps it into the node range and prepares every read-write volume:

- **Managed volumes** (those with a `*.volume.json` provisioning sidecar,
  whatever the backend: plain directory, loop-mounted ext4 or Btrfs subvolume)
  are handed to that user. The sidecar records who the volume was last handed
  to, and the plan follows from it:

  | Recorded owner | Volume root owner | Action |
  |---|---|---|
  | none (first mount) | anything | `lchown` the whole tree to the user, root mode `0755` |
  | same user | inside the container range | nothing |
  | different user | inside the container range | move files owned by (or grouped to) the old user to the new one; leave the rest |
  | anything | outside the container range | whole tree again (a snapshot restored from before the first mount, a host-side `chown`) |

  The owner is recorded only after the walk finishes, so an interrupted
  hand-over repeats. "Same user, do nothing" is the important row: Redis's
  entrypoint starts as root, `chown`s `/data` to `redis` (999) and drops to
  it. Re-chowning to root on every start would fight that, and walking a
  populated volume on every restart costs time proportional to its size. An
  image `USER` change is the one case that rewrites a populated volume, and
  it moves only what the previous user owned, so files the container gave to
  other users stay theirs. Btrfs snapshots and restores carry ownership with
  the data; the sidecar sits beside the subvolume and survives a restore.
- **Host-path volumes** (`source = ...`) belong to the operator and are never
  chowned. The host directory must be owned by the container user's host id
  (container uid `u` is host uid `2000000000 + u`), group-writable by its
  host gid, or world-writable. When the mode bits say the process can't write,
  Bun logs a warning naming the directory, its owner and the host uid to
  `chown` it to, then starts the container anyway: a read-mostly mount is
  legitimate.
- **Rootless runc** skips all of this: the volume was created by the user
  whose id is the container's only mapped id (container root).

There is no `fs_group`. Kubernetes needs `fsGroup` because a pod's volume is
shared by containers running as different users; a Reliaburger app has one
process user, and images that switch users do so from root, which can
`chown` inside the namespace once the volume is its own. The Kubernetes
importer drops `securityContext.fsGroup` with a warning.

Rootless runc has no host privilege with which to mount OverlayFS, and the
project does not yet own a FUSE snapshotter. It therefore accepts a shared image
generation only when `root.readonly = true`. A writable rootless image fails
before pull. Quietly pointing it at the shared writable tree would turn a
missing capability into cross-workload filesystem access, which is worse than
an honest refusal.

Rootless networking is userspace state, not a durable nftables map. Grill
starts one `slirp4netns` process against the container init PID and owns its API
socket and optional host forward. Schema-v2 instance records persist those
recreation parameters plus a PID/start-time fingerprint. During adoption Grill
reclaims a matching live owner, or replaces a missing owner and reapplies the
forward before returning success. It never signals a PID whose start time no
longer matches. A helper that dies while supervision probes it (its owner can
still report it running until the next 10 ms reaping tick) is replaced, not
reported. Each supervision pass starts at most three helpers, with 100 ms
linear backoff; only when all of them exit before serving the API does
`state()` return "exited before readiness" with the last attempt's stderr.
Connection-level API failures (missing or refused socket, reset, EOF) are
retried within the 5 s readiness window; API refusals and conflicting
forwarding inventories fail immediately. Rootless cgroup limits remain an admission-time refusal: Bun
doesn't create a delegated user scope, so the OCI rewrite removes the rootful
cgroup path rather than fabricating a path runc cannot write.

## 2. Dependencies

| Component | Dependency Type | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **runc** | Runtime (external binary, Linux) | Low-level OCI container execution (namespaces, cgroups, seccomp). Grill writes the OCI bundle and calls `runc` directly; its `state` persists container liveness across Bun restarts. No containerd. |
| **Apple Container** | Runtime (external, macOS) | OCI container lifecycle on macOS. Grill re-adopts a running workload via `container inspect` after a Bun exec. |
| **Linux kernel 5.7+** | Hard requirement | eBPF socket-level interception (`sock_ops`, `connect4`, `sk_msg`), cgroup v2, BPF CO-RE |
| **Mustard (gossip)** | Internal subsystem | Failure detection, leader discovery, cluster membership, metadata propagation (protocol version, node labels) |
| **Meat (scheduler)** | Via leader node | Receives scheduling decisions (which workloads to run). On the leader node, Meat runs as a co-located async task. On worker nodes, scheduling decisions arrive via the reporting tree. |
| **Raft (council)** | Via council members | Committed state (app specs, secrets, config). Worker nodes receive state via the reporting tree, not directly from Raft. |
| **Onion (eBPF)** | Internal subsystem | Bun loads and manages the Onion eBPF programs and kernel maps. Onion depends on Bun for map updates when workloads start/stop or health checks change state. |
| **Pickle (image registry)** | Internal subsystem | Image pull/push, binary distribution during self-upgrade. Bun participates as a Pickle storage node. |
| **Sesame (PKI)** | Via council members | Node certificate issuance (at join), workload certificate issuance (CSR model), CA trust chain distribution. |
| **`nvidia-smi`** | Optional runtime tool | GPU detection and enumeration. Bun probes `/dev/nvidia0` and shells out to `nvidia-smi` at startup (Linux only); no vendor library is linked into the binary. If either is absent, the node reports zero GPUs and GPU workloads are refused there. |
| **nftables** | Runtime (kernel + userspace) | Perimeter firewall rules. Bun manages a dedicated nftables table. |
| **Btrfs / ext4 / xfs** | Filesystem | Volume management. Btrfs preferred (subvolume quotas, instant CoW snapshots). ext4/xfs supported with loop-mount fallback. |

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Internal Structure

Bun runs as a single Tokio async runtime with multiple subsystem tasks. Each subsystem is a long-lived `tokio::task` that communicates with others via channels and shared state.

### 3.2 Data Flow

**Inbound (workload scheduling):**

```
Leader (Meat)
  → Reporting tree (council member parent)
    → Bun on this node
      → WorkloadSupervisor
        → Grill (container) or ProcessManager (process workload)
          → containerd/runc or clone()/exec() with namespaces
```

**Outbound (state reporting):**

```
Workload event (start, stop, health change, OOM, restart)
  → WorkloadSupervisor
    → Local event log
    → Reporting tree parent (council member)
      → Council → Raft state (for cluster-wide queries)
    → Onion service map update (eBPF kernel map)
    → Ketchup log entry
    → Mayo metric update
```

**Health check loop:**

```
HealthChecker (periodic per workload)
  → HTTP GET to workload's health endpoint (via container's network namespace)
  → Result → WorkloadSupervisor
    → If state changed: update Onion service map, emit event, notify reporting tree
    → If unhealthy beyond threshold: trigger restart via Grill/ProcessManager
```

### 3.3 Key Abstractions

**Grill** abstracts the container runtime. It drives the runtime backend directly through its command-line interface — `runc run`/`runc state`/`runc exec` on Linux, the `container` CLI on macOS, and a `process` backend that spawns a host binary with no OCI runtime at all. There is no containerd daemon and no gRPC socket. Grill is responsible for:

- Translating `AppSpec` into OCI container configurations
- Creating and configuring network namespaces with port mappings
- Setting up cgroups (CPU, memory, GPU via device allow-listing)
- Mounting volumes, config files, workload identity certs, and secrets
- Attaching to container stdio streams for log capture
- Reconnecting to running containers after Bun restart

**ProcessManager** handles non-container workloads. Today (the `process` Grill backend, `src/grill/process.rs`) it validates the binary against the allowlist and then starts the host process through a durable owner and activation gate, in its own process group, with the spec's environment and stdout/stderr captured for Ketchup. Auxiliary exec commands have child owners, and application retirement waits for their confirmed cleanup too. Writing inline scripts to temporary files and marking them executable is real. The namespace/seccomp/user-drop machinery below is the **planned** design, not current behaviour:

- Validating binaries against the allowlist in `node.toml` *(shipped)*
- Writing inline scripts to temporary files and marking them executable *(shipped)*
- Creating restricted mount namespaces (allow-listed paths only) *(planned)*
- Spawning processes with PID, network, UTS, and mount namespace isolation *(planned)*
- Applying the same cgroup limits and seccomp profiles as containers *(planned)*
- Running processes as the `burger` unprivileged user *(planned)*

**WorkloadSupervisor** is the unified control plane for both container and process workloads. It does not care whether a workload is a container or a process -- it manages the lifecycle state machine, health checking, restart policies, event emission, and service map updates identically for both types.

### 4.5 On-Disk Formats

**Binary versioning layout:**

```
/usr/local/bin/

  reliaburger-v1.3.2           (previous version, kept for rollback)
  reliaburger-v1.4.0           (current version)
  reliaburger-v1.4.0.sig       (detached Ed25519 signature)
```

**Volume layout (Btrfs):**

```
/var/lib/reliaburger/volumes/
  {namespace}/
    {app_name}/
      current/                  (Btrfs subvolume, mounted into workload)
      snapshots/
        {app}-{timestamp}/      (Btrfs snapshot, read-only)
```

**Volume layout (ext4/xfs fallback):**

```
/var/lib/reliaburger/volumes/
  {namespace}/
    {app_name}/
      current/                  (loop-mounted sparse file, size-limited)
      snapshots/
        {app}-{timestamp}/      (directory copy)

**Workload identity mount (tmpfs, per workload):**

```
/var/run/reliaburger/identity/
  cert.pem                      (X.509 certificate, SPIFFE SAN)
  key.pem                       (private key)

  token                         (JWT with workload claims)
```

### 4.6 Wire Protocols

**Bun <-> container runtime:** no daemon and no gRPC. Grill spawns the runtime CLI directly — `runc run`/`runc state`/`runc kill`/`runc delete` against an OCI bundle on Linux, and the Apple `container` CLI on macOS. The `process` backend spawns the host binary itself. State survives Bun restarts because runc's own on-disk state and the Apple VM outlive the agent; Grill re-adopts them on startup.

**Bun <-> reporting tree parent:** bincode-framed messages over an mTLS TCP connection. Messages include:

- `WorkloadStateReport` -- periodic batch of workload states (instance ID, state, health, resource usage)
- `EventStream` -- real-time events (starts, stops, health changes, OOMs)
- `SchedulingDirective` -- from parent to Bun: start/stop/update workloads
- `NodeReadinessReport` -- an independently expiring lease carrying
  the live `Starting`, `Ready`, `Degraded` or `Stopped` state of every critical
  long-lived subsystem, with transition and last-error times

**Bun <-> eBPF kernel maps:** Direct memory-mapped access via `libbpf` file descriptors. Map updates are atomic `bpf_map_update_elem()` calls. No serialisation protocol -- the map keys and values are C-compatible structs (`#[repr(C)]`).

**Bun <-> nftables:** Netlink socket via the `nft` library or direct `nftnl` bindings. Rules are expressed as nftables objects and committed atomically.

### 4.7 Liveness, Readiness and Task Ownership

`GET /v1/health` answers one narrow question: is the HTTP process alive? It is
public because upgrade supervisors and local process managers need a cheap
liveness probe. It does not claim that Bun can schedule safely.

`GET /v1/readiness`, `GET /v1/capabilities` and
`GET /v1/capabilities/cluster` require an authenticated caller. The first
returns 200 only when every registered critical owner is `Ready`; it returns
503 with the complete state evidence otherwise. The local capability endpoint
combines that decision with live DNS, egress and registry state, build/runtime
fingerprints, topology and server-owned test policy. Every capability is
`available`, `unavailable` or `unknown`, and the snapshot expires after 15
seconds. Merely wiring a metrics, logs or events store produces `unknown`
freshness, not a green claim.

The cluster endpoint calls the local endpoint concurrently on every current
member with one five-second deadline. Peer calls use the cluster HTTP client
(mTLS when configured) and internal service token. A missing token refuses the
call rather than retrying anonymously. The collector checks the schema,
expected node identity, expiry and a 1 MiB response bound, then retains failed
or timed-out peers as explicit `unknown` results.

Readiness and local capability inputs are direct reads from a process-wide
evidence tracker, so a dead agent command loop cannot make the endpoint hang or
fabricate a healthy answer.

The reporting worker sends readiness in its own frame. The leader
leases it by aggregator receive time and leadership epoch, independently of
ordinary state and capability frames. A missing or stale readiness lease makes
the scheduler mark the node unready. One healthy heartbeat cannot keep another
dead subsystem looking alive.

Task ownership decides restart policy. Unique socket listeners and one-consumer
channels are non-reconstructible owners: Bun records an unexpected exit as
`Degraded` and never starts a second claimant. A task may restart only when a
factory can recreate everything it owns. That path has an explicit retry count,
recovery deadline, delay and shutdown deadline. The security-state/CRL refresh
loop uses it; the agent, API, registry, DNS, ingress, gossip, Raft and reporting
owners do not.

### 4.8 Phase 15 resource leases

Phase 15-created apps live under a server-owned lease, not the lifetime of a
Relish process. `POST /v1/test/leases` creates a random 128-bit lease id and a
dedicated `rbtest-*` namespace. `POST /v1/test/leases/{id}/renew` extends an
active lease and `DELETE /v1/test/leases/{id}` starts cleanup. The owner may
read, renew and release it; an Admin may inspect or release it. Creation and
renewal also require the server's `provision_isolated_workloads` permission.
The cluster safety class and protected-cluster gate still apply.

The server accepts at most 64 live lease records, at most 128 resources per
lease, and a lifetime from one second up to the configured maximum (which has
an absolute 86,400-second ceiling). An ordinary apply may never use an
`rbtest-*` namespace. A leased apply carries
`X-Reliaburger-Test-Lease: <id>` and may contain apps plus the lease's matching
namespace quota declaration. Bun fills an omitted app namespace with the
lease's namespace and rejects a different one.

Standalone Bun writes `test-leases.json` under `[storage].data`, flushes it
before asking the agent to deploy, and retains a `cleaning` record until the
agent confirms every app stopped. A per-lease operation guard also prevents
expiry cleanup overtaking a deploy which the agent accepted but hasn't
finished; unrelated leases still proceed concurrently. Cluster Bun stores
leases in `DesiredState`; one Raft entry adds both the app spec and its
ownership, so a client cannot die between those actions. Lease mutations sent
to a follower reach the leader with the original user's bearer/cookie
credentials. The leader repeats normal authentication and policy checks. It
never substitutes the internal service principal.

A one-second reaper resumes expired or interrupted cleanup. Every agent or
consensus step has a ten-second bound. Failure leaves the record in `cleaning`
with its resource list and bounded last error intact; restart and leadership
transfer therefore retry instead of forgetting ownership. Standalone release confirms the runtime stop.
Cluster release removes apps and their owned namespace declaration from
replicated desired state, after which ordinary reconciliation removes any
remaining runtime instance. The runner separately polls every node for runtime
absence before it calls cleanup confirmed.

Version one owns apps and their namespace quota declaration. Jobs, faults,
credentials, images, mounts and node state need their own resource variants
before their Phase 15 cases can use this contract.

## 5. Operations

### 5.1 Container Lifecycle

**Start a container workload (full sequence):**

1. Receive `AppSpec` from WorkloadSupervisor (originally from the scheduler via the reporting tree).
2. Transition state to `Pending`.
3. **Prepare image:** Check Pickle local cache. If missing, fetch from Pickle peers (content-addressed, mTLS). If not in any Pickle node, pull from the external registry configured in `node.toml`. Transition to `Preparing`.
4. **Allocate port:** Request a host port from PortAllocator. The allocator picks a random available port from the configured range (default 10000-60000) and marks it as in-use.
5. **Create cgroup:** CgroupMgr creates a cgroup v2 hierarchy: `/sys/fs/cgroup/reliaburger/{namespace}/{app_name}/{instance}/`. The OCI spec carries the hard limits — `cpu.max` (from `cpu.limit`) and `memory.max` (from `memory.limit`) — and, when a workload declares a request, the request-derived soft controls `cpu.weight` and `memory.high` in the `linux.resources.unified` map (see §5.4). GPU device allow-listing via the cgroup `devices` controller is a follow-up (see §5.4 GPU note).
6. **Prepare network namespace:** Create a new network namespace. Configure the veth pair and port mapping (host port -> container internal port). Attach Onion eBPF programs to the namespace's sockets.
7. **Decrypt secrets:** For any `EnvValue::Encrypted` in the env map, decrypt using the cluster's age private key in memory. Plaintext is never written to disk.
8. **Prepare workload identity:** Generate a keypair, send CSR to the nearest council member, receive the signed X.509 certificate. Write cert, key, CA chain, and JWT to a tmpfs mount.
9. **Mount volumes and config files:** Bind-mount declared volumes from the host filesystem. Write `ConfigFileSpec` contents to temp files and bind-mount them read-only at the declared paths.
10. **Run init containers (Initialising):** For each init container in declaration order, create a container via containerd sharing the main container's network namespace and volumes. Wait for exit code 0. If any fails, transition to `Failed` and emit event.
11. **Create and start the main container (Starting):** Call `containerd::containers::create()` with the OCI spec (rootfs, namespaces, cgroups, mounts, env, seccomp). Call `containerd::tasks::start()`. Attach to stdout/stderr streams and pipe to Ketchup.
12. **Health wait (HealthWait):** After `initial_delay`, begin sending HTTP GET to `health` path via the container's network namespace IP and declared port. Continue at `interval` until `threshold_healthy` consecutive successes.
13. **Running:** Register the instance in the Onion service map (eBPF kernel map). The workload now receives traffic via DNS resolution and connect() rewriting. Emit a `WorkloadRunning` event to the reporting tree.
14. **Ongoing health checking:** HealthChecker continues probing at `interval`. If `threshold_unhealthy` consecutive failures: transition to `Unhealthy`, remove from Onion service map, emit event. If the workload recovers (`threshold_healthy` consecutive passes), transition back to `Running` and re-add to service map.
15. **Restart on persistent unhealthiness:** If the workload remains `Unhealthy` and the restart policy permits, transition to `Stopping`, send SIGTERM, wait `drain_timeout`, send SIGKILL if still alive, then loop back to step 2 with incremented `restart_count` and exponential backoff.

**Stop a container workload:**

1. Transition to `Stopping`. Remove from Onion service map.
2. Wrapper stops routing new connections. Existing connections drain for `drain_timeout`.
3. Send SIGTERM to the container's PID 1.
4. Wait up to `drain_timeout` for the container to exit.
5. If still running, send SIGKILL.
6. Transition to `Stopped`. Release the host port back to PortAllocator. Remove the cgroup. Clean up the network namespace. Emit event.

**Reconnect after Bun restart:**

1. On startup, Grill queries containerd for all containers with the `reliaburger.managed=true` label.
2. For each container, reconstruct the `WorkloadId` from container labels.
3. Re-attach to stdout/stderr streams (Ketchup log capture resumes).
4. Read the container's current state from containerd.
5. Resume health checking.
6. Re-populate the Onion service map from the discovered containers.
7. Compare the discovered state against the expected state from the reporting tree and reconcile (start missing workloads, stop unexpected ones).

### 5.2 Process Workload Lifecycle

> **Status: the isolation stack (steps 7-12) is planned — not yet implemented.** What ships today is the admission gate in step 3 (deny-by-default binary allowlist plus honest refusal of isolation a node can't provide) followed by a direct host `spawn` of the binary, in its own process group, with the spec's environment and stdout/stderr captured (`src/grill/process.rs`). The mount/PID/network/UTS namespaces, the seccomp profile, and dropping to the `burger` user (steps 7-12 below) describe the target design; a process workload currently runs as a child of its durable foreground owner, without that isolation stack. Treat steps 7-12 as the roadmap, not a description of the running binary.

**Start a process workload:**

1. Receive `AppSpec` from WorkloadSupervisor. Verify `WorkloadSource` is `Exec` or `Script`.
2. Transition to `Pending`.
3. **Admission (deny-by-default):** Before anything is allocated, the WorkloadSupervisor refuses a workload this node can't honour. Host execution is **deny-by-default**: an `Exec` binary runs only if its absolute path appears in `node.toml`'s `[process_workloads] allowed_binaries`, and a `Script` runs only if the interpreter (`/bin/sh`) is allowlisted too — a script is just host execution of the shell, so an empty allowlist refuses it exactly like an un-listed binary. An empty or absent allowlist therefore denies every host workload, not allows it. (Container workloads via runc/apple are unaffected; the allowlist gates only ProcessGrill host execution.) The refusal is a `DeployFailed` error surfaced to the caller, not a silent drop. Mount isolation is enforced here too: if the config asks for it on a node that can't provide it (a non-Linux host), the deploy is refused rather than run with a host process that can see every workload's volumes.
4. **Write inline script (Script only):** Write the script content to a temporary file in a Bun-managed temp directory (outside any workload's mount namespace). Mark it executable (`chmod 0755`). Compute and record the SHA-256 hash for the event log.
5. **Allocate port:** Same as container workloads -- request from PortAllocator if the workload declares a port.
6. **Create cgroup:** Identical to container workloads (step 5 of 5.1).
7. **Create namespaces:** Use `clone()` with `CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNET | CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWUTS` to create a child process in isolated namespaces.
8. **Set up mount namespace:** In the child, create a restricted filesystem view:
   - **Default read-only mounts:** `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/ssl`
   - **Default read-write mounts:** A per-workload tmpfs at `/tmp`; the volume path if declared
   - **Blocked (not mounted):** `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/sudoers`, `/var/lib/reliaburger`, other workloads' paths, `/root`, `/home`, `/dev` (except granted GPU devices)
   - **Explicitly granted:** Each `allow_paths` entry is bind-mounted (read-only by default, read-write if `:rw` suffix)
9. **Set up network namespace:** Same as container workloads -- veth pair, port mapping, Onion eBPF attachment.
10. **Decrypt secrets and prepare identity:** Identical to container workloads (steps 7-8 of 5.1).
11. **Apply seccomp profile:** Load the default seccomp profile (blocks `mount`, `reboot`, `kexec_load`, `init_module`, etc.). Identical to the container seccomp profile.
12. **Drop privileges:** Switch to the `burger` user. Apply granted capabilities (if any) via `prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT)`.
13. **Exec the binary (Starting):** `execve()` the binary with args (for Exec), or the temp script file (for Script). Capture stdout/stderr and pipe to Ketchup.
14. **Health wait, running, health checking:** Identical to container workloads (steps 12-15 of 5.1).

**GPU and rootless admission.** The same admission gate rejects two more silent lies the review flagged. A workload requesting a GPU (`gpu = N`) is refused when `[resources] gpu_enabled = false` or when GPU detection found fewer than `N` devices on the node -- `gpu_enabled` is now effective rather than a node that reports zero GPUs quietly accepting the work. GPU detection is real: Bun probes `/dev/nvidia0` and, when present, parses `nvidia-smi --query-gpu` to count cards, falling back cleanly to "no GPUs" on any node without the hardware or the tool. (OCI `/dev/nvidia*` device passthrough into the container spec is a follow-up; this pass makes placement honest rather than passing an ungoverned device set.) On a **rootless** node, a workload declaring cpu/memory limits is refused rather than run silently unlimited: rootless runc can't set cgroup limits without a systemd user scope Bun doesn't yet wire, so the honest answer is to fail the deploy and tell the operator to run as root or drop the limits.

**Stop a process workload:**

1. Identical to stopping a container, but signals are sent directly to the process PID rather than through containerd.
2. Cleanup includes: removing the cgroup, removing the network namespace, deleting the temp script file (if Script), releasing the host port.

### 5.3 Health Checking

Bun's HealthChecker runs as a dedicated async task that manages a priority queue of upcoming health checks across all workloads on the node.

**Algorithm:**

```
loop {
    next_check = priority_queue.peek() // earliest deadline
    sleep_until(next_check.deadline)

    instance = next_check.instance
    spec = next_check.health_spec

    // Probe via the workload's network namespace
    result = http_get(
        addr: instance.container_ip,
        port: instance.internal_port,
        path: spec.path,
        timeout: spec.timeout,
        namespace_fd: instance.network_namespace_fd,
    )

    health_result = match result {
        Ok(status) if status.is_success() => HealthStatus::Healthy,
        Ok(status) => HealthStatus::Unhealthy,
        Err(Timeout) => HealthStatus::Timeout,
        Err(ConnectionRefused) => HealthStatus::ConnectionRefused,
        Err(_) => HealthStatus::Unknown,
    }

    // Update consecutive counters
    match health_result {
        Healthy => {
            instance.consecutive_healthy += 1;
            instance.consecutive_unhealthy = 0;
        }
        _ => {
            instance.consecutive_unhealthy += 1;
            instance.consecutive_healthy = 0;
        }
    }

    // Evaluate state transitions
    if instance.state == HealthWait
       && instance.consecutive_healthy >= spec.threshold_healthy {
        transition(instance, Running)
        onion_service_map.add(instance)
    }

    if instance.state == Running
       && instance.consecutive_unhealthy >= spec.threshold_unhealthy {
        transition(instance, Unhealthy)
        onion_service_map.remove(instance)
    }

    if instance.state == Unhealthy
       && instance.consecutive_healthy >= spec.threshold_healthy {
        transition(instance, Running)
        onion_service_map.add(instance)
    }

    // Schedule the next check
    priority_queue.push(instance, now + spec.interval)

    // Emit result
    event_log.append(HealthCheckResult { ... })
}
```

**Health checks for workloads without a `health` field:** Bun uses process liveness as the health signal. If the main process exits, the workload is considered unhealthy and is restarted per the restart policy.

### 5.4 Cgroup Management

Bun uses cgroup v2 exclusively. The cgroup hierarchy is:

```
/sys/fs/cgroup/reliaburger/
  {namespace}/
    {app_name}/
      {instance}/
        cpu.max          = "{limit_us} {period_us}"   // from cpu.limit
        memory.max       = {limit_bytes}              // from memory.limit
        io.max           = {blkio_limits}             // for fault injection disk-io throttle
        cgroup.procs     = {pid}
```

**CPU accounting:**

- `cpu.max` is set from the `cpu.limit` field. For "500m" (500 millicores), this becomes `50000 100000` (50ms of CPU time per 100ms period). This is what the generated OCI spec carries (`OciCpuResources { quota, period }` in `src/grill/oci.rs`).

**Memory accounting:**

- `memory.max` is the hard limit. When exceeded, the OOM killer activates. This maps to `memory.limit`. It is the only memory field written to the OCI spec (`OciMemoryResources { limit }`).

> **Requests (`cpu.weight` / `memory.high`) — implemented.** When a workload
> declares a request, Grill emits a `cpu.weight` (from `cpu.request`, via
> `cpu_weight_from_millicores`) and a `memory.high` (from `memory.request`) into
> the OCI `linux.resources.unified` map, so runc writes them to the container's
> cgroup v2. This gives proportional CPU sharing under contention and graceful
> memory-pressure reclaim before the hard `memory.max` OOM. A limit-only spec
> (no request) emits no unified entries and is byte-identical to before.

> **OOM detection via `memory.events` inotify — planned, not yet implemented.** There is no inotify watch on `memory.events` today, so an OOM kill is observed only through the workload's exit and the ordinary restart path, not as a distinct structured OOM event with the cgroup's memory state.

**GPU device isolation:**

- Bun detects NVIDIA GPUs at startup by probing `/dev/nvidia0` and parsing `nvidia-smi --query-gpu` (Linux only, no vendor library linked in), and admission refuses a GPU workload when GPU support is off or fewer cards exist than requested (see the admission gate in §5.3.1).
- Writing `devices.allow` for the specific `/dev/nvidia{N}` device, and setting `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`/`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` in the workload's environment, is the OCI passthrough follow-up: placement is honest today, but the allocated device is not yet plumbed into the container spec. **TODO(Phase-follow-up):** OCI `/dev/nvidia*` device passthrough.

### 5.5 Self-Upgrade Sequence

The self-upgrade mechanism replaces the Bun binary on every node in a rolling fashion. Bun is the orchestrator for its own upgrade. This section describes the shipped implementation (Phase 14, `src/upgrade/`); the design rationale for the choices below lives in `docs/plans/2026-07-06-plan-self-upgrade.md`.

Three decisions shape everything that follows, and each earns its keep against the alternatives an earlier draft assumed:

1. **Directives travel over the node HTTP API, not the reporting tree.** The reporting tree is upstream-only (reports and acks flow towards the leader). Adding a downstream command path would have changed its bincode wire format mid-phase, and mixed-version wire formats are exactly what an upgrade creates. So the leader POSTs to each node's token-authenticated `/v1/upgrade/apply` instead.
2. **Version discovery polls `GET /v1/version`, not gossip.** Adding a version field to the gossip `MembershipUpdate` would break bincode decoding for the old nodes still running during the mixed-version window. Polling an HTTP endpoint carries no such wire-format risk. Rejoin is confirmed separately (see the orchestrator's completion gate below): a node is only "done" once it is back in the gossip mesh *and* HTTP-healthy at the target version.
3. **The leader upgrades in place; there is no leadership transfer.** openraft 0.9 has no graceful transfer, and a naive `raft.trigger().elect()` on a follower can't win against a live leader's heartbeats (anti-disruption / leader-stickiness). So the leader execs itself LAST: exec is sub-second, a council of ≥3 keeps quorum through the bounce, and the returning node re-establishes leadership and finishes the run via the orchestrator's poll-first idempotency. (`POST /v1/cluster/elect` stays a manual admin recovery tool; the upgrade path does not use it.)

**Node-level upgrade sequence (executed on each node that receives a directive):**

```
1. Receive the upgrade directive at POST /v1/upgrade/apply (leader → node,
   bearer-token authenticated). Directive (UpgradeDirective) contains:
     - upgrade_id           idempotency key
     - target_version       e.g. "v1.4.0"
     - binary_sha256        content address in Pickle
     - embedded_signature   Ed25519, from the release key set
     - external_signature   Ed25519, from the operator's external key
                            (mandatory for network upgrades; None air-gapped)
     - source               Pickle { registry_address } or LocalFile { path }

   Re-delivering the same upgrade_id while it is in flight is a no-op; a
   node that already REVERTED this id refuses to re-attempt it (the
   crash-loop guard). A retry via `relish upgrade resume` is issued under a
   fresh id so it looks like a new run.

2. Fetch the binary from Pickle, content-addressed by binary_sha256 (the
   leader stored it there before starting the run). Air-gapped upgrades read
   the local file instead. An unavailable registry (connection error,
   cut-off body, 5xx/408/429, or a timeout: 5 s for headers, 60 s per
   attempt, 75 s ceiling for the whole fetch) is retried for 10 s; if it is still down the
   node answers 503, which the leader treats as transient and re-sends with
   backoff (3 s doubling to 30 s) for up to 2 minutes before pausing. Any
   other refusal (409: a 4xx from the registry, a failed verification, a
   version the policy refuses) pauses the run at once.

3. Verify integrity, in this order:
   a. SHA-256 of the received bytes matches binary_sha256.
   b. embedded_signature verifies against the key set compiled into the
      CURRENT running binary.
   c. external_signature verifies against external_signing_key in node.toml
      (required for network upgrades).
   Any failure aborts before staging: the node reports failure and does NOT
   swap.

4. Stage the binary and its detached signature under the version store,
   then flip the current symlink atomically to the new version.

5. Exec the new binary in place (execve). The PID does not change; running
   containers keep serving. On startup the new Bun ADOPTS its still-running
   workloads from on-disk instance records (see 5.1 reconnect / grill
   adopt) rather than restarting them, re-attaches log capture, resumes
   health checking, re-populates the Onion service map and rejoins gossip.

6. Automatic rollback on a failed swap: if the new binary crashes or fails
   its boot checks, the node reverts the symlink to the previous version,
   execs it, and records the reverted upgrade_id so the leader observes the
   revert on its next version poll and pauses the run.
```

**Cluster-level upgrade orchestration (leader-side, `src/upgrade/orchestrator.rs`).**

The whole rolling walk lives in Raft under `DesiredState.active_upgrade`, so a leader change mid-run is a *resume*, not a restart: whichever node holds leadership drives the loop from the replicated state. Each tick polls reality first (`GET /v1/version` per node) and takes at most one round of actions, which makes every directive idempotent by observation.

```
1. Start: relish verifies the binary (SHA-256 + dual signatures) and pushes
   it to the leader's Pickle. The leader records the plan in Raft. The plan's
   per-node ROLE and ADDRESS are derived server-side from gossip membership
   and the Raft voter set — a client can't upgrade a node under a false
   identity (a spoofed address or a mislabelled leader is rejected).

2. Workers, in batches of --parallel (default 1):
   direct each, then wait until it polls back healthy at the target AND
   gossip reports it Alive again. Any failure pauses the run.

3. Council members, strictly one at a time, and only while quorum has
   headroom. Headroom counts LIVE voters (configured voters cross-referenced
   against gossip Alive), not just configured ones: with a voter already
   down, upgrading another that would drop live voters below quorum is
   refused.

4. Leader last, in place (see decision 3 above): the current leader directs
   its own /v1/upgrade/apply, execs, and the returning process finishes the
   run. No leadership handoff.

A node reaches "Healthy" only when it is on the target version, HTTP-healthy,
AND back in the gossip mesh. A node that comes up HTTP-healthy but never
rejoins gossip is held (and eventually times out and pauses the run) — it is
isolated, not done.
```

**Rollback:**

```
$ relish upgrade rollback [version]
```

- Runs the SAME order as an upgrade (workers → council → leader last), not the reverse. Leader-last is the invariant that keeps the orchestrator coordinated, and it holds in both directions.
- The previous binary is already on every node's disk, so there is no download or Pickle distribution step — rollback is faster than the initial upgrade.
- The leader rolls back last, in place, exactly as it upgrades last.

### 5.6 `node.toml` Parsing

Bun parses `/etc/reliaburger/node.toml` at startup. The parsing sequence:

1. Check for the file at `/etc/reliaburger/node.toml`. If absent, use all defaults (suitable for `relish init` on the first node).
2. Deserialize the TOML using `serde` with `#[serde(default)]` on all fields.
3. **Validate:**
   - `cluster.join` addresses must be valid `host:port` pairs.
   - `storage.*` paths must be absolute.
   - `resources.reserved_cpu` must be a valid resource string (e.g. "500m").
   - `resources.reserved_memory` must be a valid resource string (e.g. "512Mi").
   - `network.port_range` must have `start < end` and both in 1024-65535.
   - `process_workloads.allowed_binaries` entries must be absolute paths. If any contain glob characters (`*`, `?`, `[`) and `allow_globs` is false, fail with an error.
   - `upgrades.external_signing_key` must be a valid `ed25519:` prefixed key if present.
4. **Auto-detect missing values:**
   - `node.name`: read from `gethostname()`.
   - `network.advertise_address`: detect from the default route interface.
   - GPU labels (`gpu = "true"`, `gpu_model = "a100"`): detect via `/dev/nvidia0` + `nvidia-smi` if `resources.gpu_enabled` is true.
5. **Create storage directories** if they do not exist. Set ownership to the `reliaburger` system user.
6. **Hot reload:** Bun watches `node.toml` via `inotify`. On change, it re-parses and applies non-disruptive changes (labels, image config, log retention, metrics intervals). Changes to `storage.*` paths, `network.port_range`, or `cluster.join` require a Bun restart and are logged as warnings.

---

## 6. Configuration

All configuration is in `/etc/reliaburger/node.toml`. Every field has a default; the minimal configuration for joining a cluster is:

```toml
[cluster]
name = "default"
join = ["10.0.1.5:9443"]
```

## 7. Failure Modes

### 7.1 Bun Process Crash

**What happens:** Bun exits unexpectedly (panic, SIGSEGV, OOM-killed).

**Detection:** systemd (or equivalent init system) detects the process exit. The Mustard gossip layer on peer nodes detects the heartbeat timeout (default 5 seconds).

**Impact:**

- Running containers are NOT affected. containerd/runc keeps them alive.
- eBPF programs persist in the kernel. Onion service discovery and firewall rules continue functioning for existing connections.
- No new containers can be started or stopped.
- Health checking pauses. Unhealthy instances are not removed from the service map until Bun restarts and re-evaluates.
- Log capture (Ketchup) stops. Logs are buffered in the container's stdout pipe (Linux pipe buffer is 64KB per default; larger with `F_SETPIPE_SZ`).
- Metrics collection (Mayo) stops.
- The Onion service map becomes stale (no updates for new workloads or health changes).

**Recovery:** systemd restarts Bun. On startup, Bun reconnects to running containers (see 5.1 reconnect), resumes all operations, and reconciles state with the cluster via the reporting tree.

### 7.2 Container Runtime (containerd) Crash

**What happens:** containerd exits unexpectedly.

**Detection:** Bun's Grill layer detects the broken gRPC connection to the containerd socket.

**Impact:**

- Running containers continue (runc is the actual runtime; containerd is the management layer).
- Bun cannot start, stop, or inspect containers until containerd restarts.
- Health checks that probe the workload's network endpoint still work (they use the network namespace directly, not containerd).

**Recovery:** systemd restarts containerd. containerd reconnects to running containers via shim processes. Bun's Grill layer re-establishes the gRPC connection and resumes operations.

### 7.3 Node Disk Full

**What happens:** A storage path runs out of space.

**Detection:** Bun monitors disk usage for each configured storage path. Alerts fire at 80% utilisation (warning) and 90% (critical). `relish wtf` reports disk pressure.

**Impact:** Depends on which path is full:

- `data` full: Raft log cannot append. Node cannot commit state changes. If this node is a council member, it falls behind.
- `images` full: Image pulls fail. New container starts that require image layers fail.
- `logs` full: Log writes fail. Bun drops log lines and increments a dropped-logs counter (visible in metrics and `relish wtf`).
- `metrics` full: Metric writes fail. Downsampled data is retained; full-resolution data is dropped.
- `volumes` full: Application writes fail with EDQUOT (Btrfs) or ENOSPC (loop mount).

**Recovery:** Bun triggers garbage collection on the affected path. For images, unreferenced layers are removed. For logs and metrics, retention policies are enforced aggressively. For volumes, the operator must increase the volume size or delete data.

### 7.4 Process Workload Binary Missing

**What happens:** The binary specified in `exec` does not exist at the declared path, or has been removed since the allowlist was configured.

**Detection:** Bun checks binary existence during the `Preparing` phase (step 3 of 5.2).

**Impact:** The workload transitions to `Failed`. An event is emitted with a clear error message: `"binary not found: /usr/local/bin/node_exporter"`.

**Recovery:** The operator installs the binary on the node and re-deploys, or removes the workload from the cluster configuration.

### 7.5 Health Check Endpoint Unreachable

**What happens:** The workload's health check endpoint does not respond, returns errors, or times out.

**Detection:** HealthChecker's `threshold_unhealthy` consecutive failure counter.

**Impact:** After `threshold_unhealthy` failures (default 3), the workload is marked `Unhealthy` and removed from the Onion service map. It stops receiving new traffic. If the restart policy permits, Bun restarts the workload.

**Recovery:** Automatic. If the workload recovers (returns healthy responses), it is re-added to the service map after `threshold_healthy` consecutive passes (default 1).

### 7.6 Self-Upgrade Failure

**What happens:** The new binary fails to start after the upgrade exec.

**Detection:** The new Bun exits within 30 seconds, or fails to rejoin gossip within 60 seconds.

**Impact:** This node is temporarily unable to accept new work. Running containers are unaffected (containerd manages them independently).

**Recovery:** Automatic rollback. Bun reverts the symlink to the previous version, execs the old binary, and reports the failure to the leader. The leader pauses the cluster-wide upgrade. The operator can fix the issue and resume, or roll back the entire cluster.

### 7.7 Gossip Partition

**What happens:** This node loses connectivity to the gossip mesh.

**Detection:** Mustard detects the absence of heartbeats from peers. The reporting tree parent detects the node as unreachable.

**Impact:**

- The node continues running its workloads normally.
- The cluster stops routing new traffic to this node's workloads (the service map on other nodes is updated by their respective Bun agents based on gossip/reporting tree state, not by this node).
- The node cannot receive new scheduling decisions.
- If the node was a council member, it may fall behind on Raft.

**Recovery:** When connectivity is restored, Mustard's gossip protocol converges within seconds. The reporting tree re-establishes. The node reconciles its state and resumes normal operation.

### 7.8 OOM Kill of a Workload

**What happens:** A workload exceeds its `memory.max` cgroup limit and the kernel's OOM killer terminates it.

**Detection:** the workload process is killed by the kernel; Bun observes the exit through the ordinary supervision path. A dedicated `memory.events` inotify watch that would surface the `oom_kill` increment as a distinct event is **planned — not yet implemented** (see §5.4).

**Impact:** The workload process is killed immediately. The workload transitions to `Stopped`, then restarts per the restart policy with exponential backoff.

**Recovery:** Automatic restart with backoff. Once the `memory.events` watch lands, the OOM event will be logged with full memory state (current usage, limit, peak) and surfaced via `relish wtf`; today an OOM kill looks like any other unexpected exit.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Attack Surface

| Surface | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Process workloads access host binaries** | Larger attack surface than containers (host filesystem access) | **Shipped:** binary allowlist in `node.toml` (deny-by-default) plus admission refusal of isolation a node can't honour. **Planned (not yet implemented):** restricted mount namespace, seccomp profile, `burger` unprivileged user — a process workload currently runs as an ordinary child of the Bun process with no namespace, seccomp, or user isolation |
| **Self-upgrade replaces the Bun binary** | A compromised upgrade could replace the orchestrator | Dual-signature verification (embedded key set + external key), no auto-update, admin role required, binary verified twice (leader + each node) |
| **Secret decryption in Bun's memory** | Bun process memory contains plaintext secrets | Secrets are decrypted in memory only, never written to disk. `mlock()` the decryption buffer to prevent swapping. Zero the buffer after injection. |
| **eBPF programs run in kernel space** | A malicious eBPF program could compromise the kernel | eBPF programs are compiled into the Bun binary (not loaded from external files). The kernel's BPF verifier rejects unsafe programs. |
| **containerd socket access** | Access to the containerd socket allows arbitrary container operations | The socket is owned by root and the `reliaburger` group. Only Bun has access. It is NOT mounted into any workload's namespace. |
| **Smoker fault injection** | Faults could disrupt production | Workload faults require Deployer plus the server's `inject_workload_faults` grant and acknowledgement; node/council and pressure faults require Admin plus their matching server grants. Duration limits, no persistence across restarts and blast-radius guards still apply. |
| **`node.toml` contains external signing key** | Compromise of `node.toml` reveals the external key | File permissions 0600, owned by root. The external key is a public-key-like verification key, not a signing private key -- it verifies signatures, it cannot create them. |
| **Inline script execution** | Arbitrary code execution via git push | Lettuce enforces `require_signed_commits` for any config containing `script` fields. Scripts must be signed by a trusted key. |

### 8.2 Trust Boundaries

> **Note: the "Process workloads" boundary below is the planned target, not the current state.** Process workloads today run under durable foreground owners without the PID/network/mount/UTS namespaces, seccomp filter, restricted filesystem view, or `burger` user shown in that box. The container-workload boundary is real; the process-workload isolation is the roadmap described in §5.2.

```

### 8.3 Restricted Capabilities

> **Status: planned — not yet implemented.** The capability model below describes the target isolation for process workloads. Today a process workload is a plain host `spawn` with no capability filtering, so this section is design intent, not current enforcement.

The following capabilities are explicitly NOT available to process workloads:

- `NET_ADMIN`: Cannot modify network configuration. Prevents interference with the cluster's networking layer.
- `NET_RAW`: Cannot craft arbitrary packets. Use `capture = true` for read-only packet capture scoped to the workload's own network namespace.

Available capabilities (require `admin` role, logged as security events):

- `SYS_PTRACE`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `CHOWN`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`

### 8.4 Seccomp Profile

> **Status: planned — not yet implemented for process workloads.** No seccomp profile is applied to a host-spawned process workload today. The profile below is the intended default once the isolation stack lands.

The default seccomp profile blocks the following syscall families (identical for container and process workloads):

- `mount`, `umount2` -- prevents filesystem manipulation
- `reboot` -- prevents system reboot
- `kexec_load`, `kexec_file_load` -- prevents kernel replacement
- `init_module`, `finit_module`, `delete_module` -- prevents kernel module manipulation
- `pivot_root` -- prevents root filesystem changes
- `swapon`, `swapoff` -- prevents swap manipulation
- `sethostname`, `setdomainname` -- prevented even within UTS namespace for defense in depth
- `keyctl` -- prevents kernel keyring access

---

## 9. Performance

### 9.1 Design Targets

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Apps per node | 500 | Design goal from Section 2 |
| Per-app overhead (Bun tracking) | < 1ms | Sub-millisecond at 500 apps |
| Memory per app (Bun tracking) | ~1.2 MB | Measured: 312 MB at 500 apps vs 48 MB idle = ~528 KB tracking + workload overhead |
| Bun agent memory (idle) | ~48 MB | Baseline: Tokio runtime, eBPF management, gRPC channels, config |
| Bun agent memory (500 apps) | ~312 MB | Scales linearly with app count |
| eBPF service map entries | 500/node, 5M cluster-wide (10K nodes) | One entry per workload instance |
| eBPF map memory (kernel) | ~0.8 MB per node | Measured at ~5,800 entries |
| Health check latency (per probe) | < 5ms p99 (same node) | HTTP GET via network namespace; no proxy hop |
| Port allocation | O(1) | Bitmap-based allocator, random selection |
| Container start time (image cached) | < 1.2s to first healthy | Measured: containerd create + task start + health pass |
| Self-upgrade per node | ~40s | Drain + stage + exec + reconnect + health verify |
| Self-upgrade full cluster (12 nodes) | ~8 min | Sequential workers + sequential council + leader |

### 9.2 Scaling Considerations

**500 apps per node:** At 500 apps, Bun manages 500 cgroups, 500 network namespaces, 500 health check loops, and 500 entries in the Onion service map. The HealthChecker processes ~50 health checks per second (500 apps / 10s interval). Each check is a non-blocking HTTP GET that completes in microseconds to milliseconds. The Tokio runtime handles this without thread-per-check overhead.

**10,000 nodes:** Bun itself is not affected by cluster size. The reporting tree ensures that each Bun instance communicates only with its parent (a council member), not with all other nodes. The Onion service map on each node contains entries for all workloads in the cluster (~5M at max density), which fits comfortably in kernel memory (~80 bytes per entry = ~400 MB, well within typical server memory).

**Port allocation at density:** The default port range of 10000-60000 provides 50,000 ports. At 500 apps with rolling deploys (briefly 2x ports during transitions), this is 1,000 ports maximum = 2% utilisation. Port exhaustion is not a concern.

### 9.3 Memory Budget

```
Bun process:
  Tokio runtime + core:                 ~15 MB
  Grill (containerd client, state):     ~8 MB
  Onion (eBPF management, userspace):   ~5 MB
  Ketchup (log buffers):                ~5 MB
  Mayo (local metrics state):           ~5 MB
  Pickle (image index):                 ~3 MB
  Mustard (gossip state):               ~2 MB
  Wrapper (routing table, TLS):         ~3 MB
  Brioche (compiled UI assets):         ~2 MB
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  Idle total:                           ~48 MB

  Per-workload overhead:
    State tracking + health:            ~0.5 KB
    Ketchup log buffer:                 ~4 KB
    Event ring buffer entry:            ~0.2 KB
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Per-workload:                       ~5 KB
    500 workloads:                      ~2.5 MB

  Majority of the 312 MB at 500 apps is containerd client state,
  cached container metadata, and Ketchup log buffers for active
  streams.
```

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Unit Tests

Unit tests cover individual components in isolation using mocked dependencies.

**Grill unit tests:**

- OCI spec generation from `AppSpec` (correct namespace flags, cgroup params, mount entries, env vars)
- Port allocation and release (no leaks, no duplicates, correct range enforcement)
- Cgroup path construction and parameter calculation (millicores to `cpu.max` conversion, memory limit encoding)
- Container state machine transitions (all valid transitions, rejection of invalid transitions)
- Reconnect logic (mock containerd returning containers with Reliaburger labels)

**ProcessManager unit tests:**

- Binary allowlist validation (exact match, glob match, glob rejection when `allow_globs = false`)
- Mount namespace construction (default visible paths, blocked paths, `allow_paths` with `:rw` suffix)
- Script temp file creation and hash computation
- Isolation config derivation from `AppSpec`

**HealthChecker unit tests:**

- Priority queue scheduling (correct ordering by deadline)
- Consecutive counter logic (healthy threshold, unhealthy threshold, counter reset)
- State transition decisions (HealthWait -> Running, Running -> Unhealthy, Unhealthy -> Running)
- Timeout handling (probe timeout vs health_timeout)

**NodeConfig unit tests:**

- TOML parsing with all defaults
- TOML parsing with all fields specified
- Validation errors (invalid port range, glob without `allow_globs`, non-absolute paths)
- Auto-detection fallbacks (hostname, advertise address)

**UpgradeManager unit tests:**

- Signature verification (valid signature, invalid signature, missing external key)
- Symlink management (create, update, rollback)
- Version retention (keep N versions, garbage collect older)

### 10.2 Integration Tests

Integration tests run against a real cluster using `relish test`. Bun-specific tests:

```
Process Workloads
  - process app runs, gets health checked, appears in service map
  - inline script job runs and completes
  - process workload has correct namespace/cgroup isolation
  - process workload binary not in allowlist is rejected
  - process workload cannot see /var/lib/reliaburger
  - process workload cannot see other workloads' volumes
  - allow_paths mounts are accessible with correct permissions

Health Checks
  - app returns 200, verify marked healthy
  - app returns 500 after 30s, verify marked unhealthy + rescheduled
  - app hangs (no response), verify timeout detection
  - health check recovery re-adds to service map

Container Lifecycle
  - deploy app with 3 replicas, verify placement
  - rolling deploy with zero downtime (continuous health probe)
  - deploy broken image, verify auto-rollback
  - volume write survives container restart
  - init container failure prevents main container start

Self-Upgrade (requires dedicated test cluster)
  - upgrade single node, verify containers survive
  - rollback single node, verify revert
  - full rolling upgrade across cluster
  - upgrade failure triggers automatic rollback on affected node
```

**Test apps:** A lightweight HTTP server (~200 lines of Rust) is compiled into the Bun binary. It supports configurable health check behaviour: return 200, return 500 after N seconds, hang indefinitely, or allocate memory until OOM. This enables integration tests to exercise failure modes without external dependencies.

### 10.3 Chaos Tests

Chaos tests use Smoker fault injection to verify resilience. Bun-relevant chaos tests:

```
Node Failure
  - kill node, verify replicas rescheduled to surviving nodes
  - drain node, verify zero-downtime migration
  - kill node running volume app, verify alert fires

Resource Exhaustion
  - OOM kill app instance, verify restart + health recovery
  - CPU stress to 95%, verify app continues serving (degraded)
  - fill disk to 90%, verify alert fires + gc triggers

Process Faults
  - SIGKILL a workload, verify restart and health recovery
  - SIGSTOP a workload, verify health checks fail and trigger restart
  - SIGCONT a frozen workload, verify health recovery

Bun Restart
  - kill Bun process, verify containers continue running
  - kill Bun process, verify Bun reconnects on restart
  - kill Bun during a rolling deploy, verify deploy resumes after restart
```

### 10.4 Benchmark Coverage

`relish bench` measures Bun-specific metrics:

- **Time to first healthy instance:** Container pull + create + start + health pass. Target: < 1.2s (image cached).
- **Memory overhead per app:** Bun memory at N apps minus Bun memory idle, divided by N. Target: ~1.2 MB.
- **Max concurrent apps sustained:** Ramp app count until Bun becomes unstable or per-app overhead exceeds 1ms. Target: 500.

## 11. Prior Art

### 11.1 Kubernetes kubelet

**What it does:** The kubelet is the per-node agent in Kubernetes. It watches the API server for Pod specs assigned to its node, manages container lifecycle via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), performs health checks (liveness, readiness, startup probes), and reports node/pod status.

**Docs:** https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/ and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/kubelet

**What we borrow:**

- The three-probe health check model (liveness/readiness/startup) inspired our health check state machine, though we simplify it to a single `health` endpoint with `initial_delay` + threshold-based state transitions. Kubernetes's three separate probe types with different consequences (liveness kills, readiness removes from service, startup gates both) adds operational complexity that most users get wrong. Our single probe covers readiness semantics (remove from service map when unhealthy, re-add when healthy) and liveness semantics (restart after persistent unhealthiness).
- The concept of node-level resource reservations (`reserved_cpu`, `reserved_memory`) for system overhead.
- The CRI abstraction (our Grill serves the same purpose).

**What we do differently:**

- kubelet communicates with the API server directly; Bun uses a hierarchical reporting tree to avoid all-to-all communication.
- kubelet manages Pods (groups of containers with shared namespaces); Bun manages individual workloads (one process per isolation boundary). The Pod abstraction adds complexity that is rarely needed.
- kubelet has no concept of process workloads. Running host binaries under orchestrator control requires workarounds (hostPath volumes, privileged containers, or DaemonSets with host networking).
- kubelet does not manage its own upgrades. Cluster upgrades require external tooling (kubeadm, kops, EKS/GKE managed control plane).

### 11.2 HashiCorp Nomad Client

**What it does:** The Nomad client agent runs on every node, receives task allocations from the server, and manages task lifecycle via task drivers (Docker, exec, raw_exec, java, etc.).

**Docs:** https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/concepts/architecture and https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/drivers

**What we borrow:**

- The `exec` and `raw_exec` task drivers are the direct inspiration for our process workloads. Nomad proved that non-container workloads managed by an orchestrator is a valuable pattern.
- The concept of task drivers as pluggable runtime backends (our Grill + ProcessManager serve the same role, but compiled in rather than pluggable).

**What we do differently:**

- Nomad's `raw_exec` runs with no isolation by default (no namespaces, no cgroups). Our process workloads always get full isolation (PID, network, mount, UTS namespaces + cgroups + seccomp). There is no "raw" mode.
- Nomad's client does not include service discovery, metrics, or log collection. These are separate systems (Consul, Prometheus, external log aggregator). Bun includes all of them.
- Nomad does not include a built-in image registry or eBPF service mesh. These are external concerns.

### 11.3 Docker / Moby

**What it does:** Docker provides a container runtime and management daemon (dockerd) that handles image pull, container creation, lifecycle management, and networking.

**Docs:** https://docs.docker.com/engine/ and https://github.com/moby/moby

**What we borrow:**

- The UX model of declarative container specs with sensible defaults.
- The concept of port mapping (container port -> host port) for networking without overlays.

**What we do differently:**

- Docker is a general-purpose container runtime; Grill is purpose-built for Reliaburger's specific needs (eBPF integration, Onion service map updates, Ketchup log capture, Mayo metrics).
- Docker uses its own runtime; Grill uses containerd (which Docker also uses internally, but we skip the Docker daemon layer).
- Docker has no concept of cluster scheduling, health-check-aware service discovery, or process workloads.

### 11.4 containerd

**What it does:** containerd is a container runtime daemon that manages the complete container lifecycle: image transfer, container execution via runc, storage, and network namespace setup.

**Docs:** https://containerd.io/docs/ and https://github.com/containerd/containerd

**What we borrow:**

- containerd is our actual container runtime. Grill is an abstraction layer on top of containerd's gRPC API.
- containerd's shim model (shim processes that outlive the daemon) is what enables containers to survive Bun restarts.
- Content-addressed storage for image layers (Pickle extends this pattern to cluster-wide distribution).

**What we do differently:**

- We use containerd as a library/service, not as a user-facing tool. Operators never interact with containerd directly.
- We do not use containerd's built-in CRI plugin (which is designed for Kubernetes). We use the lower-level containerd API directly via Grill.

### 11.5 systemd

**What it does:** systemd is the init system and service manager on most Linux distributions. It manages service lifecycle, cgroups, and logging (journald).

**Docs:** https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ and https://systemd.io/

**Relevance:**

- Process workloads that Bun manages are similar in spirit to systemd units. The difference is that Bun integrates them into the cluster's scheduling, service discovery, health checking, and metrics pipeline -- things that systemd cannot provide.
- Bun itself runs as a systemd unit for process supervision (restart on crash).
- systemd's cgroup management model (one cgroup per unit) inspired our one-cgroup-per-workload model, though we manage cgroups directly rather than delegating to systemd.

### 12.2 Evaluation Notes

**`libbpf-rs` vs `aya`:** Both provide eBPF support in Rust. `libbpf-rs` wraps the C `libbpf` library and provides CO-RE support, meaning eBPF programs compiled once run on different kernel versions without recompilation. `aya` is a pure Rust implementation that avoids the C dependency but is younger and has less battle-tested kernel compatibility. For a system that must run on kernel 5.7+ across diverse distributions, `libbpf-rs`'s maturity and CO-RE support are the safer choice. Revisit if `aya` matures to equivalent kernel coverage.

**`nftnl` GPL concern:** The `nftnl` crate has a GPL-2.0 license. If this is incompatible with the project's licensing, the alternative is to invoke the `nft` CLI as a subprocess for nftables management. This is slightly less performant (process spawn per rule change) but avoids the license issue. Atomic rule application is still possible via `nft -f <file>`.

**`containerd-client` vs raw gRPC:** Using the official `containerd-client` crate saves effort and ensures API compatibility. The trade-off is a dependency on the containerd project's release cadence. If the crate lags behind containerd releases, we can fall back to raw `tonic` gRPC with protobuf definitions generated from containerd's `.proto` files.

## 13. Open Questions

1. **Cgroup delegation model:** Should Bun create cgroups directly under `/sys/fs/cgroup/reliaburger/`, or should it use systemd's `Delegate=yes` mechanism to receive a delegated cgroup subtree? Direct creation is simpler but may conflict with systemd's cgroup management on some distributions. Delegated cgroups are the "correct" approach on systemd systems but add complexity.

2. **Process workload user namespace:** The whitepaper explicitly excludes user namespaces from process workloads to avoid UID/GID mapping issues with host binaries. Should there be an opt-in `user_namespace = true` for process workloads that can tolerate it? This would provide stronger isolation at the cost of potential binary compatibility issues.

3. **HealthChecker concurrency model:** At 500 apps with 10-second intervals, the HealthChecker issues ~50 probes/second. This is easily handled by a single async task. But if health check timeouts are long (e.g., 30 seconds for a slow backend), many probes may be in-flight simultaneously. Should health checks have a per-node concurrency limit? Or should we rely on Tokio's task scheduling and the timeout mechanism?

4. **containerd version pinning:** Should Bun pin to a specific containerd version (and potentially bundle it), or should it support a range of containerd versions? Bundling ensures compatibility but increases the binary size and maintenance burden. Supporting a range requires version detection and conditional code paths.

5. **Process workload restart backoff ceiling:** What should the maximum restart backoff be for a persistently failing process workload? Container orchestrators typically cap at 5 minutes. Should process workloads have a different ceiling, given that they are often system-level daemons that the operator expects to keep trying?

6. **Volume snapshot atomicity on ext4/xfs:** On Btrfs, snapshots are instantaneous and atomic (CoW). On ext4/xfs, the fallback is a directory copy, which is neither instantaneous nor atomic. Should we require Btrfs for volume snapshots, or should we implement a freeze/copy/thaw sequence for ext4/xfs (using `fsfreeze` or `FIFREEZE` ioctl)?

7. **`node.toml` hot reload scope:** Which configuration changes should be hot-reloadable vs require a Bun restart? Currently proposed: labels, image config, log retention, and metrics intervals are hot-reloadable. Storage paths, port range, and cluster join addresses require restart. Should `process_workloads.allowed_binaries` be hot-reloadable (allowing operators to add/remove permitted binaries without restarting Bun)?

8. **GPU multi-tenancy:** The current model is whole-device GPU allocation (`gpu = 1` allocates one entire GPU). Should Bun support GPU time-slicing or MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) partitioning for NVIDIA A100/H100? This would allow multiple workloads to share a GPU, improving utilisation but adding significant complexity to the Grill layer.

9. **Self-upgrade rollback detection timeout:** Currently, if the new Bun exits within 30 seconds or fails to rejoin gossip within 60 seconds, it auto-reverts. Are these timeouts appropriate for all environments? Should they be configurable in `node.toml`?

10. **nftables vs pure eBPF for perimeter rules:** The current design uses nftables for perimeter enforcement (cluster boundary, management access, egress allowlists) and eBPF for inter-app rules. Could perimeter rules also move to eBPF, eliminating the nftables dependency entirely? This would simplify the dependency tree but may lose nftables' mature logging and accounting features.

Release metadata lookup belongs to the CLI: use `relish upgrade check --url`
to override its compiled default. Node TOML rejects the obsolete `release_url`
key, which never controlled that lookup.
