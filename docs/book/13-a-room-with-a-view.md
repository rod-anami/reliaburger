# A Room with a View

You can learn a lot about a cluster by asking it one question at a time. `relish status` tells you what is running. `relish nodes` shows membership. `relish logs -f web` follows one stream. This works, but investigating a wobbling deployment turns into a small collection of terminals and a surprising amount of typing.

So we gave Relish a room with a view.

Running `relish` with no subcommand now opens an interactive terminal interface (TUI). `relish tui` does the same thing explicitly. The ordinary subcommands remain useful for scripts, CI and precise queries. The TUI is for the moment when you want to look around.

## Owning the terminal

A terminal application temporarily changes the terminal it inherited. It enables raw mode, where key presses arrive immediately, and enters the alternate screen, the separate buffer used by programmes such as `less` and `vim`. If we leave either setting behind, the user's shell looks broken. That is a rather impolite failure mode.

`TerminalGuard` owns this temporary state:

```rust
pub struct TerminalGuard {
    terminal: Terminal<CrosstermBackend<Stdout>>,
}

impl Drop for TerminalGuard {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        let _ = disable_raw_mode();
        let _ = execute!(stdout(), LeaveAlternateScreen);
        let _ = self.terminal.show_cursor();
    }
}
```

`Drop` is Rust's deterministic clean-up hook. It resembles a destructor in C++ and covers the job you might give `defer` in Go or a `finally` block in Python. When a value leaves scope, Rust calls its `drop` method. Early returns and `?` still pass through it.

Panics need one extra precaution. A panic hook restores the terminal before chaining to the previous hook, so the panic message appears on a normal screen. We don't call `process::exit` from the TUI because that would skip destructors entirely. The unexciting clean-up code is doing important work.

## Immediate-mode rendering

Ratatui uses immediate-mode rendering. On every frame we describe the whole screen from the current state. There is no persistent tree of mutable widgets and no DOM to reconcile.

The event loop draws at most ten frames per second:

```rust
let mut tick = tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_millis(100));
tick.set_missed_tick_behavior(MissedTickBehavior::Skip);

tokio::select! {
    _ = tick.tick() => {
        app.now_epoch = unix_now();
        terminal.draw(|frame| views::render(frame, &app))?;
    }
    // input and data arms omitted
}
```

`Layout` divides a `Rect` into the header, current view and status bar. Each view borrows `&TuiApp` and produces text for its section. Borrowing matters here: renderers can read the state, but the type system prevents them from quietly changing it.

Ten complete redraws per second sound wasteful until you remember the scale. Even a large terminal contains only a few thousand cells. Ratatui also computes a diff before writing escape sequences, so unchanged cells stay put.

## One loop, one owner

The TUI has several sources of work: keyboard input, a render timer, HTTP polling and WebSocket streams. We could put the state behind `Arc<Mutex<TuiApp>>` and let every task edit it. That would spread ordering rules across the programme and make rendering race with updates. Fun for all the wrong reasons.

Instead, one task owns `TuiApp`. Background tasks send `Msg` values through a bounded Tokio channel:

```rust
pub enum Msg {
    Key(KeyEvent),
    Resize(u16, u16),
    Tick,
    Data(DataUpdate),
    Stream(StreamItem),
}
```

The reducer applies one message at a time. When it needs I/O, it queues an `Effect`, such as `RefreshAll` or `OpenLogStream`. The event loop drains those requests after the state transition. This keeps the reducer deterministic and lets tests drive it with synthetic key events.

The arrangement is the Rust version of “share memory by communicating”. Ownership makes the slogan concrete: only the event-loop task has `&mut TuiApp`.

## Traits without boxes

The screen doesn't care whether its data came from Bun or a fixture. `DataProvider` captures that boundary:

```rust
pub trait DataProvider: Send + Sync + 'static {
    fn status(
        &self,
    ) -> impl Future<Output = Result<Vec<InstanceStatus>, ProviderError>> + Send;

    // nodes, jobs, events, metrics and streams follow
}
```

An `impl Future` return means “some concrete future type chosen by the implementation”. We use the provider through generics rather than `Box<dyn DataProvider>`. Async methods are not generally object-safe in the same way ordinary trait methods are: the concrete future has a compiler-generated type. Generics let the compiler monomorphise the loop for `HttpDataProvider` or `MockDataProvider`, just as it does for `BunAgent<G: Grill>`.

The mock returns fixed timestamps and canned cluster shapes immediately. The real provider wraps `BunClient`. Both feed the same reducer.

## Views as enums

Navigation is a `Vec<View>`:

```rust
pub enum View {
    Dashboard,
    Apps,
    AppDetail {
        app: String,
        namespace: String,
        tab: DetailTab,
    },
    Nodes,
    Events,
    Logs {
        app: Option<(String, String)>,
    },
    // ...
}
```

The vector is a stack. Opening a detail pushes a value; Escape pops it. The dashboard stays at the bottom, so `q` there quits while `q` in a detail view goes back.

An enum models a closed set of alternatives. Rust requires an exhaustive `match`, so adding a view forces us to decide how rendering and navigation handle it. There is no base widget class and no stringly typed route name to misspell.

`DetailTab` is another enum with six variants. It derives `Copy` because it is a small value with no owned data. Cycling a tab computes the next variant and queues any effect that the new tab needs.

## What just happened?

Before this phase Bun had logs, deploy history and metrics, but no honest cluster event feed. The TUI needed one, so we added the smallest useful store.

`EventStore` keeps 1,024 `ClusterEvent` values in a `VecDeque`. A deque supports efficient insertion at the back and removal from the front, which is exactly a ring buffer's workload. Sequence numbers increase for the lifetime of the Bun process. The store is deliberately in memory: restarting Bun clears the history.

Every recorded event also goes to a Tokio `broadcast` channel. A broadcast sender gives each subscriber its own receiver. A slow receiver can lag behind the fixed channel capacity; the WebSocket handler treats `Lagged` as “skip what you missed and continue”, not as a permanent disconnect.

The agent emits deploy, restart, unhealthy, stop, job-completed and job-failed events. Node membership and alert transitions live outside the agent task, so they remain deferred. We say that plainly rather than inventing data.

The new `/v1/jobs` endpoint follows the same rule. It exposes the supervisor's raw state, restart count and age. It doesn't manufacture a cron schedule or a duration that the supervisor never stored.

## Upgrading the connection

HTTP polling is a good fit for tables. The TUI refreshes cluster lists every five seconds and app metrics every two seconds while the Metrics tab is visible. Logs and events need lower latency, so they use WebSockets.

A WebSocket begins as an HTTP GET with upgrade headers. That first request passes through the same bearer-token middleware as the other protected API routes. Axum then hands the upgraded connection to a task that forwards log lines or serialised events.

The existing command-line log follower still uses Server-Sent Events (SSE). SSE is simple and one-way, which suits `relish logs -f`. WebSockets give the TUI one streaming mechanism for logs and events, plus a clean way to notice that the client has gone away. There is no prize for replacing a working endpoint merely to make the architecture diagram tidier.

## Streams that survive

Networks fail. The provider's stream loop reports `StreamDown`, waits five seconds and reconnects until its `CancellationToken` fires. A successful reconnect sends `StreamUp` and clears the banner.

Cancellation tokens form a tree. The session token stops every background task. Each log view gets a child token; opening another log stream cancels the previous child without ending event streaming or polling.

Both the message channel and server-side log channel are bounded. Bounded channels provide backpressure: when a consumer falls behind, producers wait instead of growing memory forever. The on-screen log history has a separate 10,000-line cap. Old lines fall off the front.

## The colon key

Pressing `:` opens a small command palette. Its language is intentionally tiny:

```text
:apps
:nodes
:jobs
:events
:logs [app]
:routes
:search
:help
:quit
```

`split_whitespace` is enough of a parser. This phase keeps the palette navigation-only, so it cannot quietly become an alternative shell with a second command-dispatch implementation.

Search is similarly modest. It scans cached apps, nodes, jobs, routes and event messages case-insensitively. Prefix matches sort first. We didn't add a fuzzy-matching crate because substring matching solves the current problem and is easy to explain.

## Testing a screen

Ratatui's `TestBackend` renders into an in-memory cell buffer. Tests render at 120 by 40 cells, concatenate the visible symbols and compare the result with an Insta snapshot. Styles are excluded deliberately. Changing a warning colour shouldn't rewrite twenty files.

Fixture time is fixed at `1_750_000_000`. Renderers never call `SystemTime::now()`, so ages and clock values don't drift between runs. This is dependency injection in its smallest form: `now_epoch` is ordinary state.

Reducer tests press synthetic `KeyEvent` values and inspect the view stack or pending effects. Integration tests run a real ProcessGrill agent and API on an ephemeral port, fetch through `HttpDataProvider`, render with `TestBackend`, and exercise WebSocket replay for events and logs. They don't need a pseudo-terminal. Raw-mode correctness stays concentrated in the small RAII guard.

Snapshots are useful only when somebody reads them. A changed snapshot is a review artefact, not a rubber stamp.

## Setting the table

Everything so far assumed a running node. A newcomer doesn't have one. Until now the honest install instructions were "clone the repository, build it, read the docs until the config makes sense". That's a poor first five minutes, so Relish also grew `relish setup`: one guided command that finds or installs `bun`, asks a handful of questions and writes a starter `reliaburger.toml`.

The interesting part is how little new machinery it needed. Phase 14 built a complete pipeline for getting trustworthy binaries onto a machine: release metadata fetching, dual Ed25519 signature verification, and the `BinaryStore` with its atomic symlink swap. Setup reuses all of it. A fresh install is just an upgrade with no previous version, staged into `~/.reliaburger/bin` through exactly the code path a live node uses to replace itself. One deliberate difference: there is no node.toml yet, so no operator signing key exists, and setup verifies the embedded release signature only. That's the same trust an air-gapped upgrade gets. And if a node is already running, setup refuses to swap the binary underneath it and points you at `relish upgrade start` instead, where the markers and automatic revert live.

The questions follow the pattern this whole chapter has been preaching: I/O at the edge, logic pure. `run` reads stdin and prints. Everything it decides is a pure function. `decide_install` compares versions and returns an enum (`NotInstalled`, `UpToDate`, `Upgradable`); `build_node_config` maps a `SetupAnswers` struct onto a full `NodeConfig`; `render_config` emits a minimal TOML file containing only the sections the user actually answered, because a newcomer's first config file should not be a wall of defaults. The test for that pair is one line of intent: parse the rendered file and assert it equals the built config. If the generated file and the node's parser ever disagree, the round-trip test fails before a user ever sees it.

There's no new Rust in any of this, which is rather the point. Struct update syntax (`IngressSection { enabled: true, ..IngressSection::default() }`) carries the whole "mostly defaults, with these overrides" story, and `bool::then_some` turns "the join answer was empty" into an `Option<String>` without an `if`/`else` in sight. By chapter thirteen, the language has stopped being the hard part.

## The manual is in the binary

The next thing a newcomer needs after a working node is somewhere to learn what it can do. Sending them back to the repository defeats the single-binary story, so `relish manual` embeds the reference: chapters live in `docs/manual/*.md`, and `rust-embed` compiles them into the executable the same way Brioche ships its dashboard assets. The example configs embed too — `relish manual examples` writes them into the current directory (skipping files you've edited), so every command the chapters print is runnable as printed.

One markdown parse, two faces. pulldown-cmark turns each chapter into an event stream; a small builder folds those events into styled ratatui `Line`s for the terminal, and the same crate's `push_html` produces the single self-contained page behind `relish manual --web`. There is no second markdown dialect to drift out of sync.

That promise is only as good as the options both sides pass to the parser, so they share one constant, `MARKDOWN_OPTIONS`, which turns on tables. The first version passed `Options::empty()` to each, and the manual's reference tables came out as raw pipes in the terminal and a single run-on paragraph in the browser. A `const` of type `pulldown_cmark::Options` works because the crate's flag type can be built at compile time; a Rust `const` is inlined wherever it's used, like a C `#define` that the compiler type-checks. In the terminal, the builder collects each row's cells as vectors of spans, then pads every column to its widest cell once the table ends. It has to wait for the end: the last row might hold the widest cell.

The terminal face is a new, deliberately generic reader: a list pane, a content pane, and fuzzy search, over nothing more than "documents with titles and lines". It follows the reducer discipline from earlier in this chapter — `ReaderState::handle_key` is a pure function the tests drive with synthetic key events; the async loop just owns the terminal and the tick.

Search here is fuzzy (the `nucleo` matcher, the engine behind the Helix editor's pickers), which looks like a contradiction: a few pages ago we declined a fuzzy-matching crate for the cluster search. Both decisions stand. Cluster search matches short, known names — apps called `web`, nodes called `node-03` — where substring matching is predictable and honest. The manual searches prose and file paths, where "clstr" should still find the cluster chapter. Same tool question, different data, different answer.

## Shipping the source

Once documents-in-the-binary machinery exists, a stranger idea becomes a small diff: `relish source` embeds the entire `src/` tree the binary was compiled from. Run it on any machine and you can browse and fuzzy-search the orchestrator's own implementation — `relish source ebpf` opens the reader with the query already typed. It's the logical end of the batteries-included argument: the code is a battery too.

The whole feature is one new module because the reader from the previous section doesn't care what it's showing. Each file becomes a document whose first line is its styled path, so one fuzzy query matches paths and contents alike. No new key bindings, no new search code, no markdown involved.

The cost is binary size, and rust-embed softens it twice. Its `compression` feature compresses each embedded file in release builds (source code deflates well), and in debug builds it doesn't embed at all — assets load from disk at runtime, so `cargo test` iterations don't pay for a 5 MB copy of `src/` on every link. That split, incidentally, is why an embed-backed test can pass in debug and still deserve a release-build check in CI.

## The command list writes itself

The manual explains how to use relish, but people landing on the repository want something shorter first: what can this thing do? The README answered that with nothing, and `docs/README.md` answered it with a hand-kept table of nearly a hundred rows that had already started to disagree with `--help`. A third copy in the README would have made three places to forget.

We already had one list that can't be wrong, because it *is* the parser. Chapter 1 showed how clap's derive turns the `Command` enum and its `///` comments into argument parsing and help text. The same derive also implements clap's `CommandFactory` trait for `Cli`, which adds an associated function (Rust's name for a function attached to a type rather than to a value, like a static method in Java or a `@classmethod` in Python): `Cli::command()` returns the whole command tree as data. `src/relish/command_reference.rs` walks it with `get_subcommands()`, `get_positionals()` and `get_about()`, skips anything marked `hide = true`, and writes a collapsible Markdown list: one line per command, its required flags and positional arguments, and the first line of its doc comment.

The one thing clap doesn't know is how a human would group the commands. That lives in a small `GROUPS` table next to the renderer, each group linking to the manual chapter that goes deeper. `render` returns a `Result`, and forgetting to place a new command in a group is an error that names the command, not a silent omission.

Keeping the README honest is a test in the relish binary. It renders the tree, splices it between the `<!-- relish-commands:start -->` and `<!-- relish-commands:end -->` markers, and fails if the file would change, telling you to run `make readme-commands`. That target runs the same test with `RELIABURGER_UPDATE_README` set, and the test writes the file instead of comparing it: the approach `insta` takes with `INSTA_UPDATE`, without a hidden subcommand shipping in every binary. The test carries `#[cfg(feature = "kubernetes")]`, conditional compilation that removes it from builds without the default feature, because `import` and `export` only exist there and the README describes the default build.

We considered a hand-written section plus a test that every command appears in it. That catches a missing command, but not a stale description or a changed argument, and it still leaves someone typing the list. Generating it cost about as much code as checking it.

## What we learned

The TUI is mostly a lesson in boundaries. One task owns mutable state. Renderers borrow it. Providers own I/O. Effects cross the line between the two. Once those boundaries were explicit, keyboard tests, HTTP tests and screen tests stopped needing special cases.

The event store is intentionally temporary. A later phase can persist events through Ketchup if operators need history across restarts. Full resolved configuration is also absent because the API doesn't expose it, and exec streaming remains request/response despite the design document's broader WebSocket sketch.

For now, Relish gives you apps, instances, nodes, jobs, routes, events, metrics and live logs in one terminal. No collection of half-forgotten watch commands required. Progress.

### Don't show yesterday's stream in today's view

Cancelling a log subscription doesn't remove messages already queued for the
UI. A late message from `team-a/web` could therefore appear after switching to
`team-b/web`. Clearing the buffer alone wasn't enough.

Each subscription now has a generation number. The forwarding task tags every
line and connection-status update with that generation, and the reducer accepts
only the current one. Opening or closing a stream advances the generation and
clears its buffered lines, scroll position and connection error. A regression
test delivers both a late line and a late disconnection after switching streams.
Neither affects the new view.

Log views also calculate their row budget from the terminal's current height.
A fixed thirty-two-line tail hid the newest messages on a short terminal and
wasted space on a tall one. Each entry occupies one row, with long lines clipped
horizontally, so wrapping can't push the tail below the viewport. Home clamps to
the oldest available page instead of skipping beyond the buffer. Tests render
both log views at short and tall sizes and check the newest and oldest entries.

### Keep the node attached to every replica

The terminal used to list only the connected node's instances, so an app whose
only replica ran elsewhere simply vanished. It now asks for cluster status and
keeps each instance's node beside it:

```rust
pub struct ClusterInstanceStatus {
    /// Node name, or `local` for a standalone agent.
    pub node: String,
    /// Node-local workload evidence.
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub instance: InstanceStatus,
}
```

`#[serde(flatten)]` keeps the JSON flat (the instance's fields sit next to
`node`) while the Rust type stays nested, so renderers can borrow
`&status.instance` and reuse their existing code. If the cluster answer is
incomplete, the UI keeps its last good data and shows the error rather than a
shorter list. Logs and deployment history still say plainly that they cover the
connected node only; one cluster-wide view doesn't make the others cluster-wide.
