# Smoker -- Fault Injection Engine

Design document for the Smoker subsystem of Reliaburger. Smoker provides built-in chaos engineering capabilities using eBPF for network faults and cgroups for resource faults. It adds no new binaries, processes, or network components -- it activates latent capabilities in the eBPF programs and cgroup controls that Bun and Onion already manage.

Sourced from whitepaper section 18 (Fault Injection).

> **Implementation status (23 September 2026).** Drop and directional service
> partition faults run in the loaded cgroup `connect4` hook, and cut the
> callers' open connections when they land. DNS NXDOMAIN runs in the userspace
> resolver. Delay is a tc netem qdisc on each runc caller's interface (§5.1.1).
> Bandwidth remains design work, and Bun rejects it instead of recording a
> fault that can't affect traffic. The pseudocode below describes the intended
> TC bandwidth implementation where it says so; it is not evidence that the
> code ships.

## 1. Overview

Every production system eventually fails. Networks partition, disks fill, processes exhaust memory. Chaos engineering -- deliberately injecting faults to verify resilience -- has proven its value at Netflix, Google, Amazon, and thousands of other organisations. However, existing tools (Chaos Monkey, Litmus, Gremlin, Chaos Mesh) are separate systems requiring installation, configuration, CRDs, RBAC policies, sidecars, or privileged DaemonSets. The barrier to entry is high enough that most teams never adopt them.

Smoker takes a different approach. Because Onion's eBPF layer already intercepts every DNS resolution and every `connect()` call at the socket level, and because Bun already manages cgroups for every container, fault injection is a natural extension of existing infrastructure. Smoker writes fault rules into dedicated BPF maps alongside Onion's service maps, and the eBPF programs check these maps on every interception.

Key design properties:

- **Zero overhead when inactive.** When no faults are active, all fault BPF maps are empty. The eBPF programs perform a single hash lookup that returns "no fault" and proceed on the normal path. No iptables rules, no tc rules, no sidecars.
- **Kernel-level fidelity.** Network faults happen at the socket layer in eBPF. Applications see real kernel error codes, not a simulation. A cgroup connect hook denies by returning zero, which the kernel surfaces to `connect()` as `EPERM` (drop and partition faults); the userspace resolver returns NXDOMAIN, so `getaddrinfo()` fails with `EAI_NONAME` (DNS faults). No simulation layer to leak abstractions.
- **Automatic safety rails.** Smoker prevents faults that would make the cluster unrecoverable: quorum protection, replica minimums, leader guarding, and mandatory expiry.
- **No persistence.** Fault rules exist only in BPF maps (kernel memory) and Bun's in-process state. They are never written to disk. A Bun restart clears all faults on that node.

Fault injection is exposed through the `relish fault` CLI subcommand. Every fault is a single command:

```bash
# Network faults
relish fault delay redis 200ms --from web --acknowledge   # tc netem on web's interface
relish fault drop api 10% --acknowledge
relish fault partition web --from payment-service --acknowledge
relish fault dns redis nxdomain --acknowledge
relish fault bandwidth api 1mbps --acknowledge            # reserved: rejected until TC ships

# Resource faults
relish fault cpu inference 50% --acknowledge
relish fault memory redis 90% --acknowledge
relish fault disk-io web 10mbps --acknowledge

# Process faults
relish fault kill web-3 --acknowledge
relish fault pause payment-service --instance <id> --acknowledge

# Node-level faults
relish fault node-drain node-05 --acknowledge
relish fault node-kill node-05 --acknowledge
relish fault node-pressure node-05 --cpu 80% --memory 90% --acknowledge

# Management
relish fault list
relish fault clear
relish fault clear redis
```

Every fault accepts common options:

```bash
relish fault drop redis 10% \
  --duration 5m \
  --instance redis-1 \
  --node node-03 \
  --acknowledge
```

If `--duration` is omitted, the fault defaults to 10 minutes and prints a warning. Faults never persist across Bun restarts.

---

## 2. Dependencies

Smoker is not a standalone subsystem. It extends three existing components:

### 2.1 Onion (eBPF Service Mesh)

The shipped network path extends Onion's cgroup `connect4` program with one
`fault_connect_map` lookup. That implements connect-time drop and directional
service partition. DNS does not use an eBPF DNS hook: the supervised userspace
responder applies NXDOMAIN (see §5.1.3). Delay needs packet-time control, so
it uses a netem qdisc on each caller container's interface instead (§5.1.1).
Bandwidth would need the same and is not implemented.

The existing Onion maps (`backend_map`, `firewall_map`) are unmodified.
`fault_connect_map` is the only fault map consumed by a loaded program.
`fault_bw_map` and the delay/TC design below are reserved contracts, not live
map ownership.

### 2.2 Bun (Node Agent)

Bun is the userspace agent that manages containers on each node. Smoker uses Bun for:

- **BPF map writes.** Bun writes fault rules into the kernel BPF maps via the `bpf()` syscall (through aya).
- **Cgroup control.** Resource faults (CPU stress, memory pressure, disk I/O throttle) use the same cgroup hierarchy that Bun already manages for container isolation.
- **Node-pressure control.** Whole-node CPU/memory pressure uses a separate,
  Bun-owned cgroup and child helper. Bun itself never joins the pressured
  cgroup. The operator must opt in with the server's `saturate_capacity`
  permission and zero-by-default CPU/memory ceilings. `--memory N%` means
  "bring node usage to N%": the helper reads `MemAvailable` once after
  joining its cgroup and holds that delta resident for the fault's lifetime.
  It does not top up or release ballast as other processes' usage moves, so
  the node-wide figure drifts with the background; the guarantee is the
  helper cgroup's resident charge, capped by `memory.max` at N% of RAM.
- **Process signals.** Process faults (SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, SIGCONT) are sent by Bun to the container's PID namespace via `kill(2)`.
- **Fault lifecycle.** Bun tracks active faults, enforces expiry timers, and cleans up fault state on expiry, crash recovery, or explicit `relish fault clear`.

### 2.3 API (Cluster Leader)

All fault injection requests flow through the cluster API on the leader node:

- **Permission checks.** Bun combines the authenticated role with a typed
  server-owned operation grant. Workload faults use Deployer plus
  `inject_workload_faults`; node/council faults use Admin plus
  `alter_node_state`; node pressure uses Admin plus `saturate_capacity`.
  Injection also needs explicit acknowledgement.
- **Safety rail enforcement.** The leader evaluates blast radius protection rules (quorum, replica, leader guards) before approving a fault.
- **Distribution.** The node that receives the request routes it. Node
  faults go to the named node. Workload faults go to the nodes that run the
  target: the receiving node reads every node's live `/v1/status`, checks the
  replica rail against the cluster-wide replica count, then sends each owner
  its share over the node-to-node API with the caller's own credential (a
  counted kill is split by how many targets each owner holds). The owner
  repeats the policy and rail checks with its own cluster-wide evidence
  before its agent signals anything, so forwarding grants no authority. A
  fault spread over several owners becomes one node-local fault per owner,
  returned together; `GET /v1/fault?cluster=true` lists every node's faults
  and a clear without an id reaches every node.
  Network faults (`delay`, `drop`, `dns`, `partition`, `bandwidth`) are routed
  to the *callers*, not the target, because the connect hook, the netem qdisc
  and the DNS responder all act on the node where a connection starts. A
  destination-wide fault goes to every live node; a `--from APP` fault goes to
  the nodes that run APP in the fault's namespace (`smoker::routing::
  plan_network_fault`). No replica rail applies to them, and the replica rail
  counts only pauses, so a network fault held by five nodes doesn't look like
  five unavailable replicas.
- **Convergence on the caller's node.** Bun doesn't write a network fault's
  kernel state once. It recomputes what the active faults want from the
  instances running now (`smoker::network::desired_connect_faults`) and applies
  only the difference, after an inject, clear or expiry, when a local instance
  starts, and on every one-second health tick. A source replica that restarts
  with a new cgroup, or is scheduled onto the node mid-fault, is covered within
  a tick; two faults that want the same `fault_connect_map` key resolve to the
  stronger one (partition over drop, likelier drop over gentler), and clearing
  one rewrites the key for the other rather than deleting it.
- **Cutting open connections.** The connect hook only sees new connections,
  so when a drop or partition key *lands* (a new key, or a drop turning into a
  partition) Bun destroys the matching established TCP sockets in each
  affected caller's network namespace: `ip netns exec rb-<instance> ss -K -tn
  state established ( dst <backend> or ... )`, with the post-rewrite backend
  addresses from the service map. A wildcard key cuts every local runc
  caller, a source-scoped key only the instance with that cgroup. Pooled
  clients reconnect and meet the fault. We chose `ss -K` (SOCK_DESTROY over
  inet_diag, `CONFIG_INET_DIAG_DESTROY`, present in stock Ubuntu kernels) over
  a `bpf_sock_destroy()` iterator: the kfunc needs kernel 6.5+ and a second
  BPF program, while `ss` ships with iproute2 on every host that already runs
  `ip netns`. DNS faults cut nothing (open connections resolved before the
  fault), and process workloads, whose sockets share the host namespace, are
  left alone.
- **Audit logging.** Every successful injection and reversal is logged as a
  structured cluster event with the authenticated credential principal,
  action, target, type and duration. Source address is not yet an event field.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 eBPF Fault Maps

Smoker adds four BPF maps to the kernel, managed alongside Onion's existing service maps. All maps are BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH with per-CPU variants where needed for performance.

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Kernel (eBPF)                                                |
|                                                               |
|  DNS interception hook (sock_ops, UDP + TCP port 53):         |
|    1. Is this a .internal query?                              |
|    2. Look up fault_dns_map[service_name]                     |
|       -> empty: normal resolution from dns_map                |
|       -> nxdomain: return NXDOMAIN response                   |
|       -> delay: hold response for N nanoseconds               |
|                                                               |
|  Connect interception hook (sock_ops / connect4):             |
|    1. Is this a virtual IP?                                   |
|    2. Look up fault_connect_map[virtual_ip:port]              |
|       -> empty: normal backend selection from backend_map     |
|       -> drop(10%): generate random, if < 10% deny (return 0, |
|          surfaced to connect() as -EPERM)                     |
|       -> delay(200ms): store timestamp, defer via timer       |
|       -> partition(from=X): check source cgroup, if match     |
|          deny (return 0, surfaced as -EPERM)                  |
|    3. Look up fault_bw_map[virtual_ip:port]                   |
|       -> empty: no throttle                                   |
|       -> 1mbps: attach token bucket rate limiter to socket    |
|                                                               |
|  BPF maps (written by Bun userspace agent):                   |
|    dns_map/backend_map -- normal Onion service discovery      |
|    fault_dns_map      -- per-service DNS fault rules          |
|    fault_connect_map  -- per-service connect fault rules      |
|    fault_bw_map       -- per-service bandwidth limits         |
|    fault_state_map    -- PRNG state, counters, timestamps     |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**fault_dns_map** -- Keyed by service name hash (u32). Values contain the fault type (NXDOMAIN or DELAY), delay duration in nanoseconds, probability (0-100), and expiry timestamp.

**fault_connect_map** -- Keyed by `{virtual_ip: u32, port: u16, source_cgroup: u64}`. The source_cgroup field is zero for faults that apply to all callers, or set to a specific cgroup ID for partition faults. Values contain fault type (DROP, DELAY, PARTITION), parameters, probability, and expiry timestamp.

**fault_bw_map** -- Keyed by `{virtual_ip: u32, port: u16}`. Values contain the rate limit in bytes per second, token bucket state (tokens remaining, last refill timestamp).

**fault_state_map** -- Keyed by CPU ID (u32). Values contain per-CPU PRNG state (u64 xorshift seed), counters for faults injected, and scratch space for delay timers.

### 3.2 Resource Fault Manager (Bun Userspace)

Resource faults operate entirely in userspace through Bun's existing cgroup and process management capabilities:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Userspace (Bun agent)                                        |
|                                                               |
|  relish fault delay redis 200ms --acknowledge                 |
|    -> API call to leader                                      |
|    -> leader validates (permissions, safety rails)            |
|    -> leader instructs target node(s) via reporting tree      |
|    -> Bun on target node writes to fault_connect_map:         |
|        key:   {virtual_ip: 127.128.0.3, port: 6379}          |
|        value: {type: DELAY, delay_ns: 200000000,             |
|                probability: 100, expires: <timestamp>}        |
|    -> eBPF program picks up new rule on next connect()        |
|                                                               |
|  Resource fault manager:                                      |
|    -> CPU stress: caps target app's cgroup cpu.max quota      |
|    -> Memory pressure: lowers target cgroup's memory.high     |
|    -> Disk I/O throttle: writes blkio cgroup limits           |
|    -> Process faults: sends signals to container PID          |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**CPU stress.** Bun caps the target container's `cpu.max` quota so the workload keeps only `100 - percentage` of its CPU entitlement (`cpu_stress_quota` in `src/smoker/resource.rs`). Capping the target's own quota — rather than burning cycles in a competing process — means the throttling is precise, lands on the workload rather than on Bun, and is lifted cleanly by restoring the saved `cpu.max` on clear or expiry. The application sees increased scheduling latency, higher tail latencies, and reduced throughput.

**Memory pressure.** Bun lowers the target container's `memory.high` soft limit to a fraction of its hard `memory.max` (`apply_memory_pressure` in `src/smoker/resource.rs`), so the kernel throttles and reclaims the workload as it crosses the soft limit. At 90%, the application has only 10% headroom before reclaim. This triggers the same kernel memory-pressure signals (PSI, `memory.high` events) as real contention, and the saved `memory.high` is restored on clear or expiry.

**Disk I/O throttle.** Bun writes to the `blkio` cgroup controller for the target container, setting read/write bandwidth limits using `blkio.throttle.read_bps_device` and `blkio.throttle.write_bps_device`. This is the kernel's native I/O throttling mechanism.

**Process faults.** Bun sends signals directly to the container's main process (PID 1 inside the container namespace). `kill` sends SIGKILL (immediate termination). `pause` sends SIGSTOP (freeze the process). `--resume` sends SIGCONT (unfreeze).

### 3.3 Request Flow

### 4.2 BPF Map Key/Value Layouts

## 5. Operations

### 5.1 Network Faults

Drop and service partition are implemented at connect time. DNS NXDOMAIN is
implemented in userspace. Delay is a netem qdisc on each caller's interface.
Bandwidth is deliberately unavailable until it can prove effect and cleanup.

#### 5.1.1 Delay (via tc netem on the caller's interface)

> **Status: implemented (Z6.3, September 2026)** for runc containers. Process
> and Apple workloads have no per-container interface to shape, so Bun refuses
> a delay on those nodes.

The connect hook can't delay anything: a cgroup `connect4` program runs
synchronously inside `connect()`, may not sleep, and only chooses between
"allow (maybe rewritten)" and "EPERM". It also never sees an established
connection again. The earlier `sock_ops` sketch (defer the ACK) had the same
blind spot for open connections and no answer for UDP.

Linux already has a packet delayer: the netem qdisc. Every runc container has
its own network namespace with one interface, `eth0`, so Bun shapes that
interface's egress. For each caller container a delay applies to, it runs
(inside the container's namespace, with the host's `tc`):

```text
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle fa01: prio bands 4 priomap 1 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent fa01:4 handle fa10: netem delay 300000us [20000us]
tc filter add dev eth0 parent fa01: protocol ip prio 1 u32 \
    match ip dst <backend-ip>/32 match ip dport <backend-port> 0xffff flowid fa01:4
```

The `prio` root keeps three ordinary bands (the default priomap sends every
packet there) and adds one band per active delay, up to 13. A u32 filter per
backend address (after the VIP rewrite, from the merged service map) steers
the caller's packets to that backend into the netem band. Everything else the
container sends is untouched. Because the delay acts on packets, it applies to
connections that were already open, and to UDP. It is one-way: requests and
the SYN are held, replies aren't, so a request/response pays the delay once
per round trip. In the podinfo demo a cache read (two redis commands, plus the
pool's own check) went from 43 ms to 945 ms under `delay redis 300ms --from
frontend`, and back to 42 ms after `relish fault clear redis`.

Bun converges delays the same way it converges connect keys
(`smoker::network::desired_delays`): the desired bands per caller come from
the active delay faults, the target's current backends and the instances
running now. Any caller whose bands differ from what Bun installed (or that
restarted since) has its tree rebuilt: delete Smoker's root if present, then
add the new one. A root qdisc that isn't `fa01:` belongs to someone else, so
Bun never deletes it and the `add` fails loudly instead. Deleting our root
restores the veth's default (`noqueue`). New callers, restarted callers and
moved backends are picked up on the next one-second tick; on clear or expiry
every tree is removed. A Bun that starts up sweeps any `fa01:` root a crashed
predecessor left behind, since faults never survive a restart.

Injection refuses honestly: on a non-runc node, when the target has no
backends, when a `--from` source has no local instance, or when `tc` fails
(the error names a missing `sch_netem` module). `sch_netem`, `sch_prio` and
`cls_u32` ship in Ubuntu's base `linux-modules` package.

Bandwidth could use the same tree (netem has a `rate` option), but it stays
unimplemented until it has its own tests.

#### 5.1.2 Drop (via PRNG in connect hook)

On each `connect()` interception, the eBPF program reads a per-CPU PRNG state from `fault_state_map`, generates a random value, and compares it to the configured drop percentage. If the random value falls within the drop range, the program denies the connection by returning 0 from the hook, which the kernel surfaces to `connect()` as `-EPERM`. No packet is ever sent.

```c
// eBPF pseudocode: drop fault in connect4 program
SEC("cgroup/connect4")
int smoker_drop_connect4(struct bpf_sock_addr *ctx) {
    struct bpf_connect_fault_key key = {
        .virtual_ip       = ctx->user_ip4,
        .port             = bpf_ntohs(ctx->user_port),
        .source_cgroup_id = 0,
    };

    struct bpf_connect_fault_value *val =
        bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_connect_map, &key);
    if (!val)
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;  // no fault, normal path

    // Check expiry
    __u64 now = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
    if (val->expires_ns != 0 && now > val->expires_ns)
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;

    if (val->action != FAULT_ACTION_DROP)
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;

    // Generate random number using per-CPU PRNG
    __u32 state_key = 0;
    struct bpf_fault_state_value *state =
        bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_state_map, &state_key);
    if (!state)
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;

    __u64 x = state->prng_state;
    x ^= x << 13;
    x ^= x >> 7;
    x ^= x << 17;
    state->prng_state = x;
    state->lookups++;

    // Check if this connection should be dropped
    __u8 roll = x % 100;  // 0-99
    if (roll < val->probability) {
        state->faults_injected++;
        // Deny by returning zero -- the cgroup connect hook's denial is
        // surfaced to connect(2) as EPERM (not ECONNREFUSED).
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_REJECT;  // maps to -EPERM
    }

    return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;  // this connection passes through
}
```

#### 5.1.3 DNS NXDOMAIN

> **Status (shipped).** DNS resolution moved to a userspace responder (`src/onion/dns.rs`; see [discovery-onion.md](discovery-onion.md) §1), so the `DnsNxdomain` fault acts *there*, not in the kernel. The agent publishes the set of faulted service names on a `watch` channel (`DnsFaultState`); the responder returns NXDOMAIN for any queried service in that set, before it consults the service map. Clear and expiry remove the service from the set (the resolver also self-corrects past a fault's expiry), so it reverses like every other Smoker fault. `DnsNxdomain` therefore does **not** require the eBPF data path — it takes effect wherever the responder runs. The `fault_dns_map` in the never-loaded in-kernel DNS object was dead code and has been removed; the eBPF listing below is kept only to teach how the same effect would look in the kernel.

The userspace check is one lookup: strip `.internal`, key the query by its bare app name (the same way every Smoker fault targets a service), and if that name is in the faulted set, answer NXDOMAIN. The application's `getaddrinfo()` call then fails with `EAI_NONAME` -- indistinguishable from a real DNS resolution failure.

The original in-kernel design checked `fault_dns_map` before the normal `dns_map` lookup and constructed the NXDOMAIN response directly in the kernel:

```c
// eBPF pseudocode: DNS NXDOMAIN fault in DNS hook
SEC("sk_skb/stream_parser")
int smoker_dns_fault(struct __sk_buff *skb) {
    // Parse DNS query from the packet
    // (Simplified -- real implementation handles TCP/UDP framing,
    //  extracts query name, validates .internal suffix)
    char query_name[64];
    int query_len = parse_dns_query(skb, query_name, sizeof(query_name));
    if (query_len <= 0)
        return SK_PASS;  // not a DNS query we care about

    // Hash the service name portion (strip .internal suffix)
    __u32 name_hash = fnv1a_hash(query_name, service_name_len(query_name));

    // Check fault map BEFORE normal service map
    struct bpf_dns_fault_key fkey = { .service_name_hash = name_hash };
    struct bpf_dns_fault_value *fval =
        bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_dns_map, &fkey);

    if (!fval)
        goto normal_resolution;  // no fault, proceed to Onion dns_map

    // Check expiry
    __u64 now = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
    if (fval->expires_ns != 0 && now > fval->expires_ns)
        goto normal_resolution;

    // Check probability
    if (fval->probability < 100) {
        __u32 state_key = 0;
        struct bpf_fault_state_value *state =
            bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_state_map, &state_key);
        if (state) {
            __u64 x = state->prng_state;
            x ^= x << 13; x ^= x >> 7; x ^= x << 17;
            state->prng_state = x;
            if ((x % 100) >= fval->probability)
                goto normal_resolution;
        }
    }

    if (fval->action == DNS_FAULT_NXDOMAIN) {
        // Construct NXDOMAIN response in-place:
        // - Copy the query ID from the request
        // - Set QR=1 (response), RCODE=3 (NXDOMAIN)
        // - Zero answer/authority/additional counts
        // - Keep the original question section
        construct_nxdomain_response(skb);
        return SK_PASS;  // modified packet returned to application
    }

normal_resolution:
    // Fall through to normal Onion DNS resolution
    return onion_dns_resolve(skb, name_hash);
}
```

#### 5.1.4 Partition (via source cgroup check)

A partition between service A and service B is implemented as a directional
rule in `fault_connect_map`. Bun ignores client authority over cgroup ids: it
resolves every running instance of `--from` to the cgroup-v2 inode id observed
by `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`, then installs one
source-cgroup/destination-VIP/port key per instance. It rolls back a partial
multi-key write and records the exact keys so clear, expiry and shutdown delete
what that fault owns. Omitting `--from` installs the explicit wildcard key.
Bidirectional partitions require two rules.

This service-data-plane operation is separate from
the `CouncilPartition` node fault, which blocks gossip and Raft transports and
therefore consumes the quorum safety budget. Conflating the two used to make a
service partition look like a node failure while allowing the service operation
to report success without eBPF.

```c
// eBPF pseudocode: partition fault in connect4 program
SEC("cgroup/connect4")
int smoker_partition_connect4(struct bpf_sock_addr *ctx) {
    // Get the calling process's cgroup ID
    __u64 src_cgroup = bpf_get_current_cgroup_id();

    // First, check if there is a partition rule for this
    // specific source cgroup -> destination VIP pair
    struct bpf_connect_fault_key key = {
        .virtual_ip       = ctx->user_ip4,
        .port             = bpf_ntohs(ctx->user_port),
        .source_cgroup_id = src_cgroup,
    };

    struct bpf_connect_fault_value *val =
        bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_connect_map, &key);
    if (!val) {
        // Also check the wildcard (source_cgroup_id = 0) for
        // non-partition faults (delay, drop) that apply to all callers
        key.source_cgroup_id = 0;
        val = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_connect_map, &key);
        if (!val)
            return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;
    }

    // Check expiry
    __u64 now = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
    if (val->expires_ns != 0 && now > val->expires_ns)
        return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;

    if (val->action == FAULT_ACTION_PARTITION) {
        // A cgroup socket-address hook denies by returning zero. Linux exposes
        // that to connect(2) as EPERM; no packet reaches the backend.
        return 0;
    }

    // Handle other fault types (drop, delay) as shown above
    // ...

    return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;
}
```

#### 5.1.5 Bandwidth Throttle (via tc eBPF + token bucket)

> **Status: unimplemented.** No TC classifier, qdisc or bandwidth map is
> attached to workload interfaces. The cgroup connect hook sees connection
> setup, not packet flow, so it cannot enforce a byte rate. Bun rejects
> `relish fault bandwidth` instead of swallowing a `MapNotFound` error.

The intended implementation uses a `tc` (traffic control) eBPF program attached
to the workload interface, combined with a token bucket or a kernel qdisc.
This sketch is a starting point, not shipped behaviour. In particular, merely
dropping packets above a token rate is loss injection rather than faithful
bandwidth shaping; production work should use pacing and document burst
semantics.

```c
// eBPF pseudocode: bandwidth throttle in tc program
SEC("tc")
int smoker_bandwidth_tc(struct __sk_buff *skb) {
    // Extract destination IP:port from packet headers
    struct iphdr *iph = (void *)(long)skb->data + sizeof(struct ethhdr);
    struct tcphdr *tcph = (void *)iph + (iph->ihl * 4);

    struct bpf_bandwidth_fault_key key = {
        .virtual_ip = iph->daddr,
        .port       = bpf_ntohs(tcph->dest),
    };

    struct bpf_bandwidth_fault_value *val =
        bpf_map_lookup_elem(&fault_bw_map, &key);
    if (!val)
        return TC_ACT_OK;  // no throttle, pass through

    // Check expiry
    __u64 now = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
    if (val->expires_ns != 0 && now > val->expires_ns) {
        return TC_ACT_OK;
    }

    // Token bucket algorithm:
    // 1. Refill tokens based on time elapsed since last refill
    __u64 elapsed_ns = now - val->last_refill_ns;
    __u64 new_tokens = (val->rate_bytes_per_sec * elapsed_ns) / 1000000000ULL;
    val->tokens += new_tokens;
    val->last_refill_ns = now;

    // Cap tokens at 1 second worth of burst (rate_bytes_per_sec)
    if (val->tokens > val->rate_bytes_per_sec)
        val->tokens = val->rate_bytes_per_sec;

    // 2. Check if we have enough tokens for this packet
    __u32 pkt_len = skb->len;
    if (val->tokens >= pkt_len) {
        // Enough tokens: deduct and pass
        val->tokens -= pkt_len;
        bpf_map_update_elem(&fault_bw_map, &key, val, BPF_EXIST);
        return TC_ACT_OK;
    }

    // 3. Not enough tokens: queue the packet for delayed delivery.
    //    In practice, we use TC_ACT_PIPE to redirect to a delay
    //    qdisc, or TC_ACT_SHOT to drop excess packets (simpler
    //    but less faithful).
    //    For production fidelity, redirect to a BPF ring buffer
    //    and have a timer release packets at the throttled rate.
    bpf_map_update_elem(&fault_bw_map, &key, val, BPF_EXIST);
    return TC_ACT_SHOT;  // drop excess (simplified)
    // Production: return TC_ACT_PIPE to redirect to a pacing qdisc
}
```

### 5.2 Resource Faults

Resource faults do not use eBPF. They use the same cgroup and process control mechanisms that Bun already employs for container management.

#### 5.2.1 CPU Stress via `cpu.max`

Bun caps the target container's `cpu.max` quota rather than spawning a competing
burn loop. `cpu_stress_quota(percentage, cores)` (`src/smoker/resource.rs`)
computes a `cpu.max` string that leaves the workload only `100 - percentage` of
its `cores`-core entitlement; `apply_cpu_stress` writes it to the target cgroup
after `read_cpu_max` saves the original, and clear/expiry restores the saved
value.

Capping the target's own quota is more precise than a burn process and doesn't
starve Bun. An earlier design spun burn threads in Bun's own cgroup; those
competed for whatever CPU the Bun process could get — starving Bun rather than
the workload, and impossible to lift cleanly before the deadline. (The
node-level CPU pressure fault still uses a real burn loop, because there the
intent is to load the *host*, not throttle one container.)

```rust
/// Compute the `cpu.max` quota string that leaves a workload
/// `100 - percentage` of `cores` cores, written verbatim to the
/// target cgroup's `cpu.max`. (src/smoker/resource.rs)
pub fn cpu_stress_quota(percentage: u8, cores: u32) -> String {
    let remaining = 100u64.saturating_sub(percentage as u64).max(1);
    let quota_us = remaining
        .saturating_mul(CPU_PERIOD_US)
        .saturating_mul(cores.max(1) as u64)
        / 100;
    format!("{quota_us} {CPU_PERIOD_US}")
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Memory Pressure via `memory.high`

Bun reads the target workload's hard `memory.max` and saves its current
`memory.high`. A 90% fault writes 90% of the hard limit to `memory.high`, so the
kernel forces reclaim and allocation stalls as the workload crosses that soft
boundary. Clear and expiry restore the exact saved value. A cgroup with no hard
limit is refused because there is no meaningful percentage to calculate.

There's no OOM form. Lowering `memory.max` or allocating past it kills a process
and can't be reversed. Use a Kill fault when the hypothesis concerns restart
after an abrupt termination.

#### 5.2.3 Disk I/O Throttle via blkio cgroup

Bun writes to the `blkio` cgroup controller for the target container, using the kernel's native I/O throttling mechanism.

```rust
/// Apply disk I/O throttle to a container via blkio cgroup.
/// `bytes_per_sec`: maximum throughput in bytes/sec.
/// `write_only`: if true, only throttle writes.
fn apply_disk_io_throttle(
    cgroup_path: &Path,
    bytes_per_sec: u64,
    write_only: bool,
    device_major_minor: &str,  // e.g. "8:0" for /dev/sda
) -> io::Result<()> {
    // cgroupv2: io.max file
    // Format: "MAJOR:MINOR rbps=BYTES wbps=BYTES"
    let io_max_path = cgroup_path.join("io.max");

    let value = if write_only {
        format!("{} rbps=max wbps={}", device_major_minor, bytes_per_sec)
    } else {
        format!("{} rbps={} wbps={}",
            device_major_minor, bytes_per_sec, bytes_per_sec)
    };

    fs::write(&io_max_path, value.as_bytes())?;
    Ok(())
}

/// Remove disk I/O throttle (restore unlimited).
fn remove_disk_io_throttle(
    cgroup_path: &Path,
    device_major_minor: &str,
) -> io::Result<()> {
    let io_max_path = cgroup_path.join("io.max");
    let value = format!("{} rbps=max wbps=max", device_major_minor);
    fs::write(&io_max_path, value.as_bytes())?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5.3 Process Faults

Bun sends signals directly to the container's main process (PID 1 inside the container namespace).

```rust
/// Send a signal to a container's process.
fn process_fault(
    container_pid: pid_t,        // PID in Bun's PID namespace
    fault_type: ProcessFaultType,
) -> Result<()> {
    match fault_type {
        ProcessFaultType::Kill => {
            // SIGKILL: immediate termination, simulates OOM kill or crash.
            // Bun's container supervisor will detect the death and trigger
            // the normal restart/reschedule logic.
            nix::sys::signal::kill(
                nix::unistd::Pid::from_raw(container_pid),
                nix::sys::signal::Signal::SIGKILL,
            )?;
        }
        ProcessFaultType::Pause => {
            // SIGSTOP: freeze the process. Health checks will fail after
            // the configured timeout, triggering restart/reschedule logic.
            nix::sys::signal::kill(
                nix::unistd::Pid::from_raw(container_pid),
                nix::sys::signal::Signal::SIGSTOP,
            )?;
        }
        ProcessFaultType::Resume => {
            // SIGCONT: unfreeze a previously paused process.
            nix::sys::signal::kill(
                nix::unistd::Pid::from_raw(container_pid),
                nix::sys::signal::Signal::SIGCONT,
            )?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

For `relish fault kill web --count 2 --acknowledge`, Bun selects `count`
instances randomly from all healthy instances of the service and sends SIGKILL
to each.

### 5.4 Node-Level Faults

#### 5.4.1 Node Drain

Simulates a graceful node departure. Bun on the target node marks itself as draining, stops accepting new work, and waits for running apps to be rescheduled elsewhere. This tests the same code path as a real node maintenance event.

```rust
fn simulate_node_drain(node_id: &str, duration: Duration) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Mark node as draining in the cluster state
    set_node_state(node_id, NodeState::Draining);

    // 2. Stop accepting new container placements
    disable_scheduling(node_id);

    // 3. Begin graceful eviction of running containers
    //    (same code path as real drain -- containers get SIGTERM,
    //    wait for grace period, then SIGKILL)
    for container in list_containers_on_node(node_id) {
        initiate_graceful_stop(container, DRAIN_GRACE_PERIOD);
    }

    // 4. The scheduler sees the node as draining and places
    //    replacement containers on other nodes.

    // 5. After duration expires, restore normal state
    schedule_recovery(node_id, duration, || {
        set_node_state(node_id, NodeState::Ready);
        enable_scheduling(node_id);
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

#### 5.4.2 Node Kill

Simulates an abrupt node failure. Bun on the target node immediately stops responding to gossip heartbeats, stops reporting via the reporting tree, and freezes all local coordination. From the cluster's perspective, the node has vanished. This tests failure detection, leader reconstruction, and rescheduling -- the full disaster recovery path.

Running containers on the "killed" node continue serving traffic that reaches them directly (simulating the real-world scenario where a node's network is partially reachable), but the cluster stops routing new traffic to them.

> **Status (shipped).** One reference-counted `NodeTransportGate` drops the node's gossip, Raft and reporting traffic. The gossip node shares that gate and skips its failure detector while it is closed: a dead process forms no opinions, so the node has no stale `Suspect`/`Dead` rumours about healthy peers to spread when it returns. Only its own refutation travels. `DELETE /v1/fault/{id}` on the target reverses the effect and then waits (up to 4 s) until the council has released the fault's reservation. The leader's reaper releases it only after fencing the target through its own live membership, so a successful clear means the next node fault is judged on a cluster that has seen the node back; a timeout returns 504 and a retried clear waits again.

```rust
fn simulate_node_kill(
    node_id: &str,
    duration: Duration,
    kill_containers: bool,
) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Immediately stop gossip heartbeats
    gossip_pause(node_id);

    // 2. Stop reporting tree participation
    reporting_tree_disconnect(node_id);

    // 3. Stop responding to leader health checks
    health_responder_pause(node_id);

    // 4. Optionally stop all containers (--containers too)
    if kill_containers {
        for container in list_containers_on_node(node_id) {
            send_signal(container.pid, Signal::SIGKILL);
        }
    }
    // If kill_containers is false, containers keep running but
    // are orphaned from the cluster's perspective.

    // 5. The cluster's failure detection will notice the missing
    //    heartbeats after gossip_suspicion_timeout (typically 5-10s).
    //    The leader will mark the node as failed, trigger
    //    reconstruction of state, and reschedule containers.

    // 6. After duration expires, restore the node
    schedule_recovery(node_id, duration, || {
        gossip_resume(node_id);
        reporting_tree_reconnect(node_id);
        health_responder_resume(node_id);
        // Node will rejoin the cluster via normal gossip protocol
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

### 5.5 Scripted TOML Scenarios

For multi-step fault injection (chaos game days, automated resilience tests, CI pipeline integration), faults can be defined in a TOML file:

```toml
# chaos/payment-cascade.toml
#
# Scenario: payment service database goes slow, then drops,
# then the payment service itself runs out of memory.
# Tests: circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation,
# customer-facing error handling.

name = "Payment cascade failure"

[[step]]
description = "Database CPU contention"
fault = "cpu"
target = "pg"
value = "50%"
duration = "2m"

[[step]]
description = "Database starts dropping connections"
fault = "drop"
target = "pg"
value = "25%"
start_after = "2m"
duration = "3m"

[[step]]
description = "Payment service memory pressure from retry storms"
fault = "memory"
target = "payment-service"
value = "95%"
start_after = "4m"
duration = "2m"

```

Scenario execution:

```rust
/// Execute a scripted chaos scenario.
fn execute_scenario(
    scenario: &ScriptedScenario,
    speed_multiplier: f64,    // 1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double speed
    dry_run: bool,
) -> Result<ScenarioResult> {
    let scenario_start = Instant::now();

    // Parse all steps and compute absolute activation times
    let mut timeline: Vec<(Duration, &ScenarioStep)> = Vec::new();
    for step in &scenario.steps {
        let start_after = match &step.start_after {
            Some(s) => parse_duration(s)?,
            None => Duration::ZERO,
        };
        // Apply speed multiplier
        let adjusted = Duration::from_secs_f64(
            start_after.as_secs_f64() / speed_multiplier
        );
        timeline.push((adjusted, step));
    }

    // Sort by activation time
    timeline.sort_by_key(|(t, _)| *t);

    if dry_run {
        println!("Scenario: {}", scenario.name);
        println!("Steps ({}):", timeline.len());
        for (time, step) in &timeline {
            let duration = step.duration.as_deref().unwrap_or("until scenario ends");
            println!("  T+{:>6}: {} {} {} ({}s) -- {}",
                format_duration(*time),
                step.fault, step.target, step.value,
                duration, step.description);
        }
        return Ok(ScenarioResult::DryRun);
    }

    println!("Executing scenario: {}", scenario.name);

    for (activation_time, step) in &timeline {
        // Wait until it is time to activate this step
        let elapsed = scenario_start.elapsed();
        if *activation_time > elapsed {
            let wait = *activation_time - elapsed;
            println!("  Waiting {:?} for next step...", wait);
            std::thread::sleep(wait);
        }

        println!("  T+{}: {} -- {} {} {}",
            format_duration(scenario_start.elapsed()),
            step.description, step.fault, step.target, step.value);

        // Convert step to FaultRule and submit via the normal API path
        // (which enforces permissions and safety rails)
        let fault_rule = step_to_fault_rule(step, speed_multiplier)?;
        submit_fault(fault_rule)?;
    }

    Ok(ScenarioResult::Completed)
}
```

Scenarios are version-controlled alongside application configuration. Teams can build a library of failure scenarios and replay them after every significant change.

### 5.6 Fault Expiry and Cleanup

Every fault has a mandatory expiry. Cleanup happens through three independent mechanisms for defense in depth:

1. **eBPF-level expiry check.** Every eBPF fault map lookup compares `bpf_ktime_get_ns()` against the entry's `expires_ns`. Expired entries are skipped (treated as no-fault). This means faults stop having effect immediately at expiry even if userspace cleanup is delayed.

2. **Bun userspace timer.** Bun maintains a priority queue of active faults sorted by expiry time. A background task wakes at each expiry and deletes the corresponding BPF map entry via `bpf_map_delete_elem()`. It also cleans up any resource faults (kills CPU burn processes, releases mlock'd memory, resets blkio limits).

3. **Startup cleanup.** On Bun startup, the fault registry is empty (in-process state only). Bun iterates all fault BPF maps and deletes any entries it finds. This handles the case where Bun crashed while faults were active.

```rust
/// Background task that enforces fault expiry in userspace.
async fn fault_expiry_task(fault_registry: Arc<Mutex<FaultRegistry>>) {
    loop {
        let next_expiry = {
            let registry = fault_registry.lock().unwrap();
            registry.next_expiry()
        };

        match next_expiry {
            Some(expiry) => {
                let now = monotonic_now();
                if expiry > now {
                    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(expiry - now)).await;
                }
                // Clean up all expired faults
                let mut registry = fault_registry.lock().unwrap();
                let expired = registry.drain_expired(monotonic_now());
                for fault in expired {
                    cleanup_fault(&fault);
                }
            }
            None => {
                // No active faults, sleep until woken by new fault activation
                tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
            }
        }
    }
}

/// Clean up a single fault: remove BPF map entries, kill helper processes.
fn cleanup_fault(fault: &FaultRule) {
    match &fault.fault_type {
        FaultType::Delay { .. } | FaultType::Drop { .. } | FaultType::Partition { .. } => {
            // Delete from fault_connect_map
            let key = build_connect_fault_key(fault);
            bpf_map_delete_elem(&fault_connect_map_fd, &key);
        }
        FaultType::DnsNxdomain => {
            // Userspace fault: republish the (now smaller) faulted-service
            // set so the DNS responder stops returning NXDOMAIN for it.
            republish_dns_faults();
        }
        FaultType::Bandwidth { .. } => {
            let key = build_bw_fault_key(fault);
            bpf_map_delete_elem(&fault_bw_map_fd, &key);
        }
        FaultType::CpuStress { .. } => {
            // Kill the burn loop process
            kill_helper_process(fault.id, Signal::SIGKILL);
        }
        FaultType::MemoryPressure { .. } => {
            // Kill the mlock process (kernel reclaims pages)
            kill_helper_process(fault.id, Signal::SIGKILL);
        }
        FaultType::DiskIoThrottle { .. } => {
            // Reset blkio limits to unlimited
            reset_blkio_limits(&fault.target_service);
        }
        FaultType::Pause => {
            // Send SIGCONT to unfreeze
            if let Some(pid) = get_container_pid(&fault.target_service, &fault.target_instance) {
                nix::sys::signal::kill(
                    nix::unistd::Pid::from_raw(pid),
                    Signal::SIGCONT,
                );
            }
        }
        // Kill, NodeDrain, NodeKill: no cleanup needed (effect is immediate and permanent)
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

## 6. Configuration

### 6.1 Default Duration

If `--duration` is omitted from a `relish fault` command, the fault defaults to **10 minutes**. The CLI prints a warning:

```
Warning: No --duration specified. Fault will auto-expire in 10 minutes.
```

### 6.2 Maximum Duration

Every fault has a maximum duration, configurable per cluster. The default maximum is **1 hour**.

```toml
# cluster-config.toml
[smoker]
default_duration = "10m"
max_duration = "1h"
```

Attempts to set a duration longer than `max_duration` are rejected by the leader:

```
Error: Requested duration 2h exceeds maximum allowed duration 1h.
Use a shorter duration or ask a cluster admin to increase smoker.max_duration.
```

### 6.3 Safety Overrides

Some safety rails can be explicitly overridden with flags:

| Safety Rail | Override Flag | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Leader targeting | `--include-leader` | Blocked |
| >50% node faults | `--override-safety` | Blocked |
| Quorum risk | Cannot be overridden | Always enforced |
| Last-replica kill | Cannot be overridden | Always enforced |

Overrides are logged with additional prominence in the audit log:

```
WARN: Fault injected with --override-safety by alice@myorg.
      Affects 4/6 nodes (67%). Quorum protection still enforced.
```

---

## 7. Failure Modes

### 7.1 Fault That Outlives Its Duration

**Scenario:** The userspace expiry timer in Bun fails to fire (e.g., Bun is under extreme load and the async runtime is delayed).

**Mitigation:** eBPF-level expiry check. Every fault map lookup in the eBPF programs compares `bpf_ktime_get_ns()` against the entry's `expires_ns` field. Even if userspace never cleans up, the eBPF program will stop applying the fault once it expires. The BPF map entry remains (wasting a small amount of kernel memory) until userspace eventually cleans it, but the fault has no effect.

### 7.2 eBPF Map Corruption

**Scenario:** A BPF map entry is partially written (e.g., Bun crashes mid-write) and contains garbage values.

**Mitigation:** BPF map updates via `bpf_map_update_elem()` are atomic at the kernel level -- the update either fully succeeds or fully fails. Partial writes are not possible. However, if the Rust struct serialisation produces invalid values (e.g., `probability > 100`), the eBPF program validates all fields before applying a fault. Invalid entries are treated as no-fault and a per-CPU error counter is incremented for observability.

```c
// Validation in eBPF
if (val->probability > 100 || val->action > FAULT_ACTION_MAX) {
    // Invalid entry, treat as no-fault
    __sync_fetch_and_add(&fault_error_count, 1);
    return CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_ALLOW;
}
```

### 7.3 Cleanup Failure on Bun Crash

**Scenario:** Bun crashes while faults are active. The in-process fault registry is lost.

**Mitigation:** Three-layer defense:

1. **eBPF expiry.** Active faults continue to have effect but will stop at their expiry timestamp (checked in-kernel on every lookup).

2. **Startup cleanup.** When Bun restarts, it iterates all fault BPF maps and deletes every entry. This is safe because fault state is never persisted to disk -- a Bun restart should always produce a clean state.

3. **Manual override.** `relish fault clear` sends a command directly to the Bun agent via a Unix socket (bypassing the cluster API). Even if the cluster leader is unreachable, an operator with host access can clear faults locally.

### 7.4 Resource Fault Helper Process Orphan

**Scenario:** Bun crashes while a CPU burn loop or memory pressure process is running inside a container's cgroup.

**Mitigation:** The helper process is spawned as a direct child of the Bun process. When Bun dies, the helper process receives SIGHUP. The burn loop and memory pressure processes install a SIGHUP handler that immediately exits. Additionally, cgroup limits (CPU, memory) will cause the orphaned helper to be killed if Bun's cgroup is cleaned up by the init system (systemd unit restart).

### 7.5 Node-Kill Fault Recovery Failure

**Scenario:** A node-kill fault is active and the duration expires, but the node cannot rejoin the cluster because gossip state has diverged too far.

**Mitigation:** The node-kill recovery path uses the same rejoin mechanism as a real node restart. Gossip protocol handles this via full state sync on reconnection. If the node has been "dead" for longer than the gossip tombstone window, it performs a full state pull from a seed node before resuming normal gossip.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Permission Model

Workload fault injection requires two independent server-side decisions: the
credential has at least the `deployer` role, and `[testing].allowed_operations`
contains `inject_workload_faults`. The request must also carry explicit
acknowledgement. An Admin role doesn't override a missing operation grant.
Council/node faults instead require Admin plus `alter_node_state`; node
pressure requires Admin plus `saturate_capacity`.

Every successful injection and reversal records a structured event:

```json
{
  "kind": "fault",
  "severity": "warning",
  "action": "fault.injected",
  "principal": "token:4f5c…",
  "app": "redis",
  "node": "node-03",
  "details": {
    "fault_id": "7",
    "fault_type": "DnsNxdomain",
    "duration_seconds": "300"
  }
}
```

Permission evaluation flow:

```
relish fault dns redis nxdomain --acknowledge
  -> Relish sends its bearer token; the request body carries no audit identity
  -> Leader receives request
  -> Bun authenticates the token and derives the stable credential principal
  -> Bun checks: role >= Deployer, operation grant, protected-cluster policy,
     and explicit acknowledgement
  -> If no: reject with 403 Forbidden
  -> If yes: proceed to safety rail evaluation
```

Reversal is de-escalating. It still requires the role and operation which owns
that class of fault, but it deliberately doesn't require destructive
acknowledgement or `allow_protected_mutation`. Removing an active fault must
remain possible after policy is tightened. Council partitions are node faults
on the same route, so they share this model.

`FaultSummary.injected_by` is the human-readable authenticated token name. It
is not the audit key. The event's `principal` is the stable
authenticated credential id, and Bun never accepts either value from `$USER`
or a client-supplied JSON field.

### 8.2 Blast Radius Protection

Smoker prevents faults that would make the cluster unrecoverable:

- **Quorum protection.** Cannot partition more than `(council_size - 1) / 2` council nodes. This is the hard limit that preserves Raft quorum. It cannot be overridden.
- **Replica minimum.** Cannot kill more replicas of an app than `replicas - 1`. At least one instance must survive. A pause counts as one replica with `--instance`, otherwise as all of them. Cannot be overridden.
- **Leader protection.** Cannot target the cluster leader without the explicit `--include-leader` flag.
- **Node percentage limit.** Cannot inject faults on more than 50% of nodes simultaneously without `--override-safety`.

### 8.3 No Persistence

Fault rules exist only in BPF maps (kernel memory) and Bun's in-process state. They are never written to disk. This means:

- A Bun restart on any node clears all faults on that node.
- A full cluster restart clears everything.
- There is no way for a fault to "survive" a restart and silently affect production.
- Forensic analysis of a node's disk cannot reveal what faults were injected (only the audit log, which is separate, records this).

### 8.4 Unix Socket Access Control

`relish fault clear` is designed to always work, even if the cluster API is degraded. It is processed locally by the Bun agent via a Unix socket. This socket:

- Is **not** mounted into any workload's namespace. Containers cannot invoke it.
- Is only accessible from the host filesystem or via the cluster API (which
  enforces the same role plus typed operation grant).
- Uses standard Unix file permissions (owned by root, mode 0600 or group-readable for the Bun group).

This ensures that even during a fault injection gone wrong, an operator with host access can always clear all faults.

## 9. Performance

### 9.1 Zero Overhead When Inactive

When no connect fault is active, `fault_connect_map` is empty and the loaded
program performs one additional hash lookup per intercepted VIP connection.
DNS faults run in userspace; no TC bandwidth program runs.

The original design used the following estimates. They are not current
benchmark evidence and must not be quoted as measured Reliaburger performance:

| Operation | Baseline (Onion only) | With Smoker maps (empty) | Overhead |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connect()` to VIP | ~1.2 us | ~1.25 us | ~50 ns (+4%) |
| DNS `.internal` resolution | n/a (userspace) | n/a (userspace) | not measured |
| TCP throughput (sustained) | not measured | not measured | not measured |

### 9.2 Fault Activation Latency

When a fault is activated via `relish fault`, the following latency budget applies:

| Step | Latency |
|---|---|
| CLI to leader API (network) | ~1-5 ms |
| Leader permission + safety check | ~0.1 ms |
| Leader to target node(s) via reporting tree | ~1-10 ms |
| Bun writes BPF map entry | ~0.01 ms |
| eBPF program sees new entry on next hook invocation | ~0 ms (next syscall) |
| **Total** | **~2-15 ms** |

Fault activation is effectively instantaneous from an operator's perspective. The new fault affects the very next `connect()` or DNS resolution after the BPF map write.

### 9.3 Overhead With Active Faults

When faults are active, overhead depends on the fault type:

- **Drop, Partition, DNS NXDOMAIN:** Near-zero additional overhead. The eBPF program finds the map entry, applies the fault, and returns. Faster than the normal path (no actual connection or DNS resolution happens).
- **Delay:** Negligible eBPF overhead. The actual delay is implemented by the TCP stack's DELACK timer, which is a kernel-native mechanism.
- **Bandwidth:** Token bucket computation adds ~100-200 ns per packet in the tc program. This is well within the noise of network processing.
- **CPU stress, memory pressure:** These faults intentionally consume resources. Overhead is the intended effect, not a side effect.

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Fault Injection + Recovery Verification

Each fault type must be tested not only for correct injection but also for correct recovery when the fault is cleared or expires.

**Network fault tests:**

- Inject `delay redis 200ms`, verify that connections to redis take ~200ms longer (within jitter bounds). Clear the fault, verify latency returns to baseline.
- Inject `drop api 50%`, make 1000 connections, verify ~500 fail with EPERM (within statistical bounds). Clear, verify 0% failures.
- Inject `dns redis nxdomain`, verify `getaddrinfo("redis.internal")` returns EAI_NONAME. Clear, verify resolution works.
- Inject `partition web --from payment`, verify payment->web connections fail with EPERM, verify web->payment still works. Clear, verify both directions work.
- Inject `bandwidth api 1mbps`, transfer 10MB, verify transfer time is ~10 seconds (+/- 20%). Clear, verify full bandwidth.

**Resource fault tests:**

- Inject `cpu inference 50%`, verify inference container CPU usage rises by ~50% of its cgroup limit. Clear, verify CPU returns to normal.
- Inject `memory redis 90%`, verify redis container memory usage is ~90% of limit. Clear, verify memory drops (pages released).
- Inject `disk-io web 10mbps`, perform disk write benchmark, verify throughput is ~10MB/s. Clear, verify full throughput.

**Process fault tests:**

- Inject `kill web-3`, verify web-3 PID receives SIGKILL, verify Bun detects death and reschedules. Verify other web instances are unaffected.
- Inject `pause web-3`, verify web-3 process is stopped (SIGSTOP), verify health checks fail after timeout, verify `--resume` sends SIGCONT and process resumes.

**Expiry tests:**

- Inject fault with `--duration 5s`, wait 5 seconds, verify fault is automatically cleared. Verify eBPF-level expiry (fault stops taking effect) even if userspace cleanup is artificially delayed.

**Node-level fault tests:**

- Inject `node-drain node-05`, verify containers are evicted and rescheduled. Verify node rejoin after duration.
- Inject `node-kill node-05`, verify gossip detects failure, leader reschedules workloads. Verify node rejoin after duration.

### 10.2 Safety Rail Testing

Safety rails must be tested to verify they correctly prevent dangerous faults:

- Attempt to partition a majority of council nodes. Verify rejection with QuorumRisk error.
- Attempt to kill all replicas of a service. Verify rejection with ReplicaMinimum error.
- Attempt to fault the leader node. Verify rejection unless `--include-leader` is present.
- Attempt to fault >50% of nodes. Verify rejection; a client safety override
  must not widen server policy.
- Verify that `relish fault clear` works via Unix socket even when the cluster API is unavailable.

### 10.3 Chaos Test for Smoker Itself

Smoker should be tested under its own fault conditions:

- Inject a fault, then crash and restart Bun. Verify startup cleanup removes all BPF map entries.
- Inject a fault, then kill the leader. Verify the fault continues to operate (BPF maps are on the target node, not the leader) and that `relish fault clear` still works via the local Unix socket.
- Inject multiple overlapping faults on the same service. Verify all are applied correctly and cleaned up independently.

### 10.4 Built-in recovery catalogue

The shipped `relish test --chaos` catalogue is intentionally smaller than the
fault matrix above. It tests five recovery claims which the current primitives
can make honestly:

1. council leader failure, a different elected leader, a live canary, then
   rejoin;
2. worker death while three replicas are live, all three restored on
   survivors, then rejoin;
3. minority council isolation, a live majority canary, then exact healing;
4. bounded whole-node CPU/memory pressure while the API and membership remain
   observable, then exact clearing; and
5. node death during an observed rolling deploy, a terminal non-`Unknown`
   deployment outcome, and restored replicas.

The suite runs serially. Before it creates anything, it requires three nodes,
the digest-pinned runc/Apple workload, fresh `NodeKill` and `NodePressure`
evidence, the three server operations `provision_isolated_workloads`,
`alter_node_state` and `saturate_capacity`, protected-cluster permission where
applicable, and explicit operator consent. A missing destructive prerequisite
refuses the suite rather than skipping a scenario. ProcessGrill remains a
separate profile; fixed host ports can't prove three replicas reschedule onto
two survivors.

Each case refreshes capability evidence after entering the one-wide execution
queue. Its shared `ChaosGuard` records the exact target-local fault id, owning
node and direct API client. Runner teardown reverses those ids newest first
after pass, failure, timeout or panic, then releases the workload lease.
Cleanup failure remains recorded for retry and produces `Unknown`. The
catalogue never uses blanket clear or heal as a substitute for ownership.

## 11. Prior Art

### 11.1 Chaos Mesh (Kubernetes)

[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/) is a CNCF-incubating chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes. It defines faults as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and uses an operator to reconcile them. Network faults are implemented by injecting iptables rules or tc qdisc configurations into the target pod's network namespace via a privileged sidecar container.

**Architecture:** CRDs -> Chaos Controller Manager -> Chaos Daemon (privileged DaemonSet) -> iptables/tc injection.

**Strengths:** Rich fault types (network, IO, stress, time, DNS, JVM, kernel), mature scheduling (cron-based), good Grafana dashboard integration.

**Limitations:** Requires CRD installation, RBAC configuration, and a privileged DaemonSet. iptables rules persist in the network namespace and have overhead even when no faults are active. Cleanup on controller crash requires manual CRD deletion.

### 11.2 Litmus (Kubernetes)

[LitmusChaos](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/) is another CNCF chaos engineering platform. It uses CRDs (ChaosEngine, ChaosExperiment, ChaosResult) and a Litmus agent (operator + runner pods) to execute experiments. Network faults also use iptables/tc.

**Architecture:** CRDs -> Chaos Operator -> Runner Pods (one per experiment) -> iptables/tc injection via privileged init containers.

**Strengths:** Large experiment hub (community-contributed experiments), built-in hypothesis validation, integration with CI/CD pipelines via LitmusCTL.

**Limitations:** Same iptables overhead as Chaos Mesh. Each experiment spawns runner pods, adding scheduling latency. CRD-based workflow is verbose compared to imperative CLI commands.

### 11.3 Gremlin (SaaS)

[Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/) is a commercial SaaS chaos engineering platform. It runs a privileged agent on each node that receives fault injection commands from the Gremlin control plane.

**Architecture:** SaaS control plane -> Agent (privileged container or host binary) -> tc/iptables/cgroups/signals.

**Strengths:** Polished UI, good blast radius controls, StatusCheck integration for automatic abort, team management features.

**Limitations:** SaaS dependency (requires internet connectivity, introduces a trust boundary). Privileged agent with broad host access. Cost scales with infrastructure size.

### 11.4 Netflix Chaos Monkey / Chaos Engineering

Netflix pioneered chaos engineering with [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) (random instance termination) and evolved it into the [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/). Their approach focuses on steady-state hypothesis verification in production.

**Strengths:** Battle-tested philosophy, focus on production validation rather than staging-only testing. Netflix's [ChAP (Chaos Automation Platform)](https://netflixtechblog.com/chap-chaos-automation-platform-53e6d528371f) automates hypothesis-driven chaos experiments.

**Limitations:** Chaos Monkey itself is relatively simple (instance termination only). The broader Netflix chaos tooling is proprietary and tightly integrated with their Spinnaker-based deployment pipeline.

### 11.5 Toxiproxy

[Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) is a TCP proxy that simulates network faults. Applications connect through Toxiproxy instead of directly to their dependencies.

**Strengths:** Simple, language-agnostic, no privileged access needed.

**Limitations:** Requires application configuration changes (point connections through proxy). Cannot simulate faults at the kernel level (DNS failures, cgroup pressure). Adds latency even when no faults are active (proxy hop).

### 11.6 What Smoker Borrows

- **From Chaos Mesh:** The taxonomy of fault types (network, IO, stress, time, DNS, process). The idea of scheduled/timed experiments.
- **From Litmus:** CI pipeline integration as a first-class use case. Scenario files are Smoker's equivalent of Litmus experiments.
- **From Gremlin:** Blast radius controls and automatic safety rails. StatusCheck-like abort behaviour via Smoker's safety checks.
- **From Netflix:** Production-first philosophy. Faults should be safe enough to run in production with appropriate guardrails.
- **From Toxiproxy:** The principle that fault injection should be simple to invoke (single command or API call).

### 11.7 What Smoker Does Differently

- **eBPF-native, no iptables.** Network faults operate at the socket level in eBPF, not at the packet level via iptables. This gives zero overhead when inactive (empty BPF map lookup vs. iptables rule chain traversal) and kernel-level fidelity (applications see real error codes, not RST packets).
- **Built-in, not bolted-on.** Smoker is part of the orchestrator binary. No CRDs, no operators, no DaemonSets, no sidecars. Fault injection is a natural extension of the eBPF programs and cgroup controls already in use.
- **Automatic safety rails.** Quorum protection, replica minimums, and leader guarding are enforced by default. Other systems require manual annotation or configuration to prevent dangerous faults.
- **No persistence.** BPF maps and in-process state only. No CRDs to orphan, no iptables rules to leak, no config files to corrupt. A restart always produces a clean state.
- **Imperative CLI, not declarative CRDs.**
  `relish fault delay redis 200ms --acknowledge` is simpler than writing a YAML
  manifest, applying it, waiting for reconciliation, and then deleting it to
  clean up. For repeatable tests, TOML scenario files provide declarative
  scripting without the reconciliation complexity.

## 12. Libraries and Dependencies

### 12.1 Rust Crates

**aya** -- eBPF map manipulation from Rust userspace. It provides safe wrappers around the `bpf()` syscall for map CRUD operations. Smoker uses the same library Onion already uses for its service mesh eBPF programs, sharing BPF object lifecycle management.

- `aya`: Pure Rust eBPF library. No C dependencies. Provides `aya::maps::HashMap` for typed BPF map access.

```rust
// Example: writing a fault entry using aya
use aya::maps::HashMap;

fn write_connect_fault(
    map: &mut HashMap<MapData, BpfConnectFaultKey, BpfConnectFaultValue>,
    key: BpfConnectFaultKey,
    value: BpfConnectFaultValue,
) -> Result<()> {
    map.insert(key, value, 0 /* flags: BPF_ANY */)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn delete_connect_fault(
    map: &mut HashMap<MapData, BpfConnectFaultKey, BpfConnectFaultValue>,
    key: &BpfConnectFaultKey,
) -> Result<()> {
    map.remove(key)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

**nix** -- Rust bindings to Unix system calls. Used for:

- `nix::sys::signal::kill()` -- sending SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, SIGCONT for process faults.
- `nix::unistd::Pid` -- PID type for signal targeting.
- Cgroup file operations (reading/writing cgroup control files for blkio, memory, CPU).
- `nix::sys::mman::mlock()` -- locking memory pages for the memory pressure fault.

```rust
use nix::sys::signal::{kill, Signal};
use nix::unistd::Pid;

kill(Pid::from_raw(container_pid), Signal::SIGKILL)?;
kill(Pid::from_raw(container_pid), Signal::SIGSTOP)?;
kill(Pid::from_raw(container_pid), Signal::SIGCONT)?;
```

**rand** -- PRNG for userspace operations (selecting random instances for `kill --count N`, jitter calculation in scenario timing). The eBPF programs use their own xorshift64 PRNG (BPF programs cannot call userspace random functions).

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn select_random_instances(
    instances: &[ContainerInstance],
    count: u32,
) -> Vec<&ContainerInstance> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let mut indices: Vec<usize> = (0..instances.len()).collect();
    // Fisher-Yates shuffle, take first `count`
    for i in 0..std::cmp::min(count as usize, indices.len()) {
        let j = rng.gen_range(i..indices.len());
        indices.swap(i, j);
    }
    indices.iter()
        .take(count as usize)
        .map(|&i| &instances[i])
        .collect()
}
```

### 12.2 Kernel Dependencies

- **Linux >= 5.7** -- Required for BPF ring buffer (`BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF`), used by bandwidth throttle for packet queuing.
- **CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, CONFIG_BPF_JIT** -- Required for eBPF (same as Onion).
- **CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF** -- Required for cgroup-attached eBPF programs (connect4 hook).
- **CONFIG_NET_SCH_BPF** -- Required for tc eBPF programs (bandwidth throttle).
- **cgroupv2** -- Required for blkio (`io.max`) and memory (`memory.max`, `memory.current`) cgroup controls.

## 13. Open Questions

### 13.1 HTTP-Level Fault Injection

Current network faults operate at the TCP/socket level. HTTP-level faults (injecting specific HTTP status codes like 503, adding response headers, corrupting response bodies) would require intercepting at a higher layer. Options:

- **sk_msg eBPF program** that inspects HTTP response headers in the `sendmsg` path and rewrites status codes. This is complex (HTTP parsing in eBPF is limited by instruction count and stack size) but would maintain the zero-sidecar property.
- **Userspace proxy** injected into the network path for the duration of the fault. This contradicts Smoker's "no new components" design but would be simpler and more flexible.
- **Application-level SDK** that checks a fault flag (set via shared memory or environment variable). This requires application cooperation but gives the most control.

Decision deferred. TCP-level faults cover the majority of chaos engineering use cases (connection failures, latency, partition). HTTP-level faults are a stretch goal.

### 13.2 Clock Skew Simulation

Simulating clock skew (making `gettimeofday()` / `clock_gettime()` return incorrect times) is valuable for testing distributed consensus algorithms, lease expiry logic, and certificate validation. However, intercepting time syscalls via eBPF is not straightforward:

- `clock_gettime()` uses VDSO on modern kernels, bypassing the syscall path entirely. eBPF cannot intercept VDSO calls.
- Chaos Mesh solves this by injecting a shared library (via `LD_PRELOAD`) that overrides the time functions. This requires modifying the container's environment.
- An alternative is using `CLOCK_NAMESPACE` (available in Linux 5.6+), which gives each container its own clock offset. This is clean but requires namespace setup at container creation time.

Decision deferred. Clock skew is important but the implementation options each have significant trade-offs. Needs further investigation into CLOCK_NAMESPACE feasibility.

### 13.3 Multi-Cluster Partition Testing

Simulating network partitions between clusters (rather than between services within a cluster) is relevant for multi-region deployments. This requires coordinating fault injection across multiple independent Reliaburger clusters.

Options:

- **Cross-cluster fault API** that allows one cluster's Smoker to inject faults affecting traffic to/from another cluster. Requires mutual authentication between clusters.
- **External orchestrator** (a script or CI pipeline) that issues `relish fault` commands to multiple clusters in sequence.

Decision deferred pending multi-cluster support in Reliaburger itself.

### 13.4 Fault Injection in the Data Plane vs. Control Plane

Should Smoker support faults that target the orchestrator's own control plane (gossip protocol, Raft consensus, reporting tree) in addition to application traffic? This would enable testing Reliaburger's own resilience, but introduces the risk of the fault injection system destabilizing itself.

Partial support exists: `node-kill` and `node-drain` affect the control plane indirectly. Direct control plane faults (e.g., "delay all Raft AppendEntries by 500ms") are not yet supported.

### 13.5 Observability Integration

Should Smoker emit structured events to the metrics system (Mayo) when faults are injected, so that fault injection windows are visible on dashboards alongside application metrics? This would make it trivial to correlate latency spikes with active faults during game days. The `relish wtf` diagnostic tool already detects active faults, but dashboard integration would be valuable for post-hoc analysis.
